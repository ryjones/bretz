Ant. XXVIII.- The Age of the Spokane Glaciation; by J
HaRLeN BRETZ.
The northern part of the Columbia basalt plateau in
Washington has been glaciated at least twice. During)
both glaciations the drainage from the southern margin
of the ice sheet was deflected southward across the pla-
teau. During the earlier or Spokane glaciation the vol-
ume of the waters was very great and the plateau's
southward slope was severely scoured along dozens of
huge channels.' During the later or Wisconsin glacia-
tion, the volume of escaping waters appears to have been
far less. Due to this lesser volume and the failure of
the later ice sheet to reach as far as the earlier, only two
of the older glacial drainage ways were used.
Because of the nearly horizontal position of the basalt
sheets over most of the plateau and the prevailing col-
umnar structure, the high-gradient glacial streams pro-
duced almost vertically walled channels, many of them
canyons in their proportions. The uniformity in the
character of the flows and the nearly uniform southward
slope of about 25 feet to the mile over the whole area
determined uniformity in this feature of nearly vertical
cliff's throughout the area affected.
Since the glacial rivers ceased to flow, these great
channels have carried very insignificant streams, most
of them intermittent affairs which flow only a few months
in the year. Great numbers of lakes and ponds still
exist on the irregularly eroded floors, unfilled and
undrained by subsequent stream action.
The principal
change in the abandoned waterways has been the break-
ing down of the steep cliffs and the accuntulation of
talus at their bases.
The prismatic structure of the
basalt provides an abundance of vertical joints along
which the rock breaks. The cliff faces thus remain
nearly vertical during their retreat. They decrease in
height by burial of the lower portions as the talus mounts.
The fallen material is chiefly frost-riven during the
winters. Of under-cutting, there is none. Vegetation
on cliff faces is a negligible factor. Chemical decomposi-

tion is occurring far more slowly than mechanical disin-
tegration. The only additional factor of importance in
disruption of the basalt is unequal heating and cooling.
The climate of the plateau today is semi-arid, the rain-
fall ranging from about 10 inches annually in the south-
west to 20 inches in the northeast. Seasonal and annual
temperature ranges do not vary much over the region.
The presence of many minor water courses in the mature
topography of the loess-covered portions of the plateau
indicates a former heavier precipitation but their spac-
ing and degree of development show no more noteworthy
climatic differences throughout the area than now exist.
The rate of retreat of the cliffs therefore has been
approximately the same throughout the area during the
same time.
There have been, of course, climatic fluctuations affect-
ing the area as a whole since the development of each
group of channels. But, so far as the physiographic
record goes, such changes have not introduced different
dominant factors in the destruction of the cliffs. Insola-
tion and frost action have remained in control. The
onlv effect of consequence has been to change the rate of
wastage of the vertical faces of columnar basalt. The
cliff's of the older channels have wasted during an inter-
glacial epoch, a glacial epoch (the Wisconsin) and post-
glacial time.
The cliffs left by the drainage of the later
epoch have broken down only during post-glacial time.
The rate of wastage of the older cliffs therefore has
varied at different times. Since, however, there is no
way of determining the changes in rate, this item is
ignored in the solution of the problem considered in this
paper. It probably would make but little difference with
the result.
It seems safe, therefore, to assume that that portion of
the plateau which bears the Pleistocene river courses has
not had noteworthy climatic contrasts determined by
differences in latitude, altitude or proximity to bounding
highlands since these rivers flowed.
There are thousands of miles of cliffs formed during
the earlier epoch and hundreds of miles of cliffs formed
or cleared of talus deposits during the later epoch. The
talus in the channels abandoned since the Spokane epoch
stands uniformly about three fourths of the total height
of the original cliffs; that in the channels used during the


338
J H. Bretz--Age of Spokane Glaciation.
Wisconsin epoch stands uniformly about half the total
height of the original cliffs. The angle of repose in the
talus piles lies between 30 and 35 degrees. The post-
Wisconsin talus is 35 degrees; the post-Spokane in some
places is fully as steep, in others it is nearer 30 degrees.
Among the cliffs of each group, there are exceptions to
the ratios used in the following solution. But they are
few and in most cases seem adequately explained by
exceptional local conditions.2
The problem may be stated as follows.
Given: (1) A region with nearly horizontal strata,
uniformly possessing prismatic jointing, twice during the
Pleistocene crossed by huge, short-lived, high-gradient
rivers which eroded nearly vertically walled channels and
canyons;
(2) the retreat of the cliffs of these water-
ways, with maintenance of nearly vertical faces, and
accumulation of talus at their bases as the only change
of consequence in them since their formation;
(8) the channels active during each of the
two epochs identified bv (a) the field evidence of the
glaciated areas, and (b) the greater accumulation of talus
in the older channels;
(4) the talus in the older channels three
fourths the height of the original cliffs, that in the later
channels half the height of the original cliffs.
To find; the relative lapse of time since each glacia-
tion.
The solution is based wholly on the ratio of height of
talus to height of cliff. To make a concrete problem, a
vertical cliff originally 1000 feet high is taken, and talus
fills ⅛, ¼ ⅜, ¼, ⅝, ¾ and ⅞ of this original height are
assumed.
Two factors whose numerical values are
In some places the original structure of the basalt varies from the
prevailing monotonous columnar jointing.
Ash beds, scoriaceous phases,
ellipsoidal structures, prominent platiness in the columns, unusual size of
columns; all are variant struetures. Subsequent stream work in a few
places has removed some of the talus, subsequent aggradation of channel
floors in some places makes the apparent ratio of talus height to eliff
height greater than the actual, windblown dust and sand in one tract
(Drumheller Channels, south of Moses Lake) has added considerably to
the talus accumulation, and steeply tilted flows in another place (lower
Grand Coulee) have apparently determined unusually rapid growth of talus.
All these variants were considered during the field study.
The total
mileage of eliffs departing from the ratios used is so small that the
writer believes the method of attack and the conclusion here reached as
to relative ages not to be invalidated hy their existence.

rial in the talus for each stage, and (2) the average height
of the cliff face during the time consumed for each stage.
This time will vary directly as the volume eroded and
inversely as the exposed average face.

Case C_ Angle of repose 35 degrees, fill 60 percent as

of Technology, who has proposed the assumptions on which the time ratios
are calculated, formulated the mathematical procedure and made the com
putations here presented.

In cases B and C the solution of the compound ratio
for times shows that for each case the results come out
as in Case A. The times of fill are directly proportional
to the squares of the heights filled.
Having obtained the same results for different angles
of repose and for different densities of fills, it seems fair
to assume that, though both enter into the distance eut
back, these factors do not vary with the ratios obtained,
whatever their values may be. The field evidence indi-
cates that their values are constant throughout the area.
The application of the rule obtained to the physio-
graphie problem of this paper gives us a lapse of time
since the Spokane glaciation (36t) two and a fourth times
as great as that since the Wisconsin glaciation (16t).
Assuming that the Wisconsin glaciation of the northern
part of the Columbia plateau is late Wisconsin, as the
very strong morainie expression of its drift sheet sug-
gests, this ratio would make the Spokane glaciation
equivalent to either the Iowan or early Wisconsin. The
record of prodigious quantities of water discharged at
the maximum of the Spokane glaciation is very unlike
the record of sluggish Iowan ablation in the Mississippi
Valley. On the other hand, the scanty till deposits and
total lack of terminal moraine on the area covered by the
Spokane ice is very unlike the early Wisconsin drift. If,
and when. a definite ratio for earl and late Wisconsin
and post-Wisconsin time is obtained in the Mississippi
Valley. the Spokane glaciation may be correlated defi-
nitely in the accepted scheme.
