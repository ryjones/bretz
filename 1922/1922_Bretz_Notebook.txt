THIS GRAVEL ACCUMULATION LOOKS FROM ITS TOPOGRAPHY AND ITS SITUATION WITH REWERENCE TO
B CUNDING ROCK HILLS ON EAST AND WEST AND THE OPEN VALLEY TO THE SOUTH AS THO IT WERE DEPOSITED
AS AN OUTWASH FAN AT THE EDGE OF THE ICE, THE ESCAPING WATER FLOWING SOUTHWARD.
IT SLOPES OFF
WITH A FAIRLY STEEP FRONT FOR AN ALLUVIAL FAN TO A NEARLY FLAT FLOOR JUST SOUTH OF PANTOPS STA.
RANCHES ON THIS VALLEY FLOOR HAVE WELLS 120 FT TO WATER; DUG WELLS.
THESE MUST BE IN THE
SAME FLUVIOGLACIAL DEPOSIT BUT ON THE FLATTER SLOPES FARTHER FROM APEX OF THE FAN.

IN THE COBBLES HERE, LITTLE AT PANTOPS.
BOTH HAVE SOUTHWARD DIP OF CURRENT BEDS BUT IN THIS
SECOND LOCALITY THE BEDS APPEAR TO DIP RIGHT AGAINST THE FLANK OF THE BASALT HILL.
ON THE BASALT MESA, THREE GRANITE BLDRS AT 50 FT ABOVE PANTOPS ALTITUDE.
THE BIG ANBULAR OR SUBANGULAR BLORS IN THE PANTOPS PIT SHOW CONSIDERABLE DECOMPOSITION ON
THE LESS-RUBBED SURFACE.
THE GRAVEL IN WHICH THEY ARE EMBEDDED IS FRESH. IT IS OBVIOUSLY
THAT THESE BLDRS WERE DERIVED VERY LOCALLY; IN ALL PROBABLLiTY FORM THE GRANITE HILL ON WHICH
THEY NOW LIE. DERIVED FROM THE RESIDUAL BLDRS OF DECOMPOSITION, OUTLINES DETERMIBED BY JOINTS
AND SCHISTOSITY, NOT FORN OFF BY THE GLACIAL ICE•
WHY DO THEY OCCUR WAY UP IN THE STRATIFIED GRAVEL?
THEY MIGHT WELL OCCUR IN THE BASE
OF THE DEPOSIT, HOWEVER.
IF ICE CAME OFER AÖNHILLS OF GRANITE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THIS
PANTOPS DEPOSIT, THIS WOULD BE EASILY EXPLICABLE.
MAY IT NOT BE CONCEIVABLE THAT ICE HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THEIR DETACHMENT AND TRANSPORTATION?
MAY THEY NOT HAVE ROLLED AND SLID DOWN TO
THE ACOUMULATIng OUTWASH PLAIN?

SHOULD LAKES AND SWAMPS PERSIST
IN SUCH ABUNDANCE FROM A PRE-WISCONS IN GLACIATION? AS ABGUED BY PARDEE AND LARGE, THE DRY
CLIMATE MAY EXPLAIN THE FAILURE OF THESE BASINS TO FILL.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL PARALLEL LINES OF ESCAPING WATER, NOT FAR APART BUT AT DIFFERENT

IT SEENS TO EA
DEMAND THAT EACH CHANNEL ORIGINATE AT THE EDGE.OF THE ICE, AND, SEPARATED FROM THE OTHERS BY


HIGHER LENDS, PURSUE ITS OWN COURSE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
SOME RETREAT OF THE EDGE OF THE

LAMONA, ON COAL CREEK, IS NEAR THE HEAD OF THE SECOND CYCLE VALLEY. THE SECOND CYCLE VALLEY
IS NOT A CANYON, HOWEVER.
ITS FLOOR IS BROAD AND ITS SIDES NOT VERY HIGH, THO STEEP AND ROCKY.
THIS SEEMS ODD BUT IS BELIEVED TO BE EASILY EXPLAINED WHEN CONSIDERED WITH THE VERY STRIKING
CANYON PREBORTIONS OF THE CRAB CREEK VALLEY NEAR JUNCTION OF LAKE CREEK VALLEY AND BELOW ODESSA.
BOTH HERE ARE DEEP AND NARROW AND WALLED IN WITH RUGGED PRECIPITOUS CLIFFS. THE EXPLANATION
SEEMS TO BE THAT A PARTICULARLY RESISTANT BASALT FLOW, OR GDOBR OF FLOWS, IS HERE INCISED BY THE
STREAMS.
THESE CAUSE THE UNUSUAL CANYONS AND ALSO ACT AS A TEMPORARY BASELEVEL ABOVE THE
ENTRENCHED PORTIONS.
THUS, THE VALLEY ABOVE IS OLDER, IN TERMS OF WORK DONE BY THE STREAM,
THAN THE AVERAGE IN THIS PORTION, AND THAT IN THE MORE RESISTANT PART IS YOUNGER.

SIGNIFICANCE OFTHTHIS CURIOUS DISTRIBUTION INCLEAR.
THE ONLY HYPOTHESIS WHICH SEEMS SATIS-
FAOTORY IS/HAT THIS IS THE STRAND LINE FOR THÈ SUBMERGENOE WHEN THE BERGS WERE DRIFTING, AND THAT
THEY GROUNDED ALONG THE SHORES, HERE TO MELT AnD LEAVE THEIR BURDEN OF GRANITE AND BASALT BLORS.
BUT ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE OF BEACH RIDGES OR WAVE- CUTTING HERE.
THE ORIGIN OF THE HIGH GRAVEL MESA IS A BIT PUZZLING.
IF IT SS OF WISCONSIN AGE, IT WAs
BUILT AND THEN DISSECTED SO THAT, BOTH EAsT AND WEST, CHANNELS 150 FT OR SO IN DEPTH WERE
FORMED, ALL BEFORE THE BERGS ARRIVE.
MAy IT NOT Be A REMNANT OF A PRE-WISCONSIN OUTWASH PLAIN?
IF PRE-WISCONSIN IN AGE, THERE SHOULD BE MORE WEATHERING AND MORE EROSION IN IT THAN IN THE
FLANKING LOWER TERRACES. NOTHING SEEN TO SUGGEST THIS EXCEPT PERHAPS ON THE EAST SIDE. ON
THIS SIDE, THE SLOBE IS GENTLE DOWN TO THE LOWER TRACT (EXCEPT NEAR LATITUDE OF HEAD OF MOSES
LAKE, WHERE A DEFINITE CHANNEL ON THE LOWER TRACT CUTS INTO THE EAST SIDE). IS THIS A CONSTRUC-
TONAL SLOPE? IS IT EROSIONAL?
IF THE LATTER, IT MEANS MATURITY OF SLOPES. WEST SIDE OF
MESA IS STEEP ALL THE WAY, DUE TO THE CUTTING OF THE ROCKY FORD-SOAP LAKE CHANNEL.
1 IF THE SROKANE SPILLWAYS ARE PRE-WISCONSIN, THEY LIE MANY MILES SOUTH OF THE MAPPED WISC.
T.M. # SHOULD NOT THE OKANOGAN LOBE SHOW THE SAME PHENOMENA, - GLACIAL DRIFT BEYOND LIMITS
OF WISCONSIN T.M. AT COULEE CITY, AND TERRACES OF GRAVEL, OLDER AND HIGHER THAN THE WISC. GRAVEL?
SUCH A CONCEPTION DEMANDS THAT THE GRAND COULEE FUNCTIONED AS A GLACIAL DISCHARGEWAY EARLIER THAN
ITS WISCONS IN AISTORY. OBo FURTHERMORE, THE GLACIALDRA I NAGE WHICH USED CRAB CREEK ABOVE STRATFORD
HAS THE CHARACTERS OF, AND ALMOST CONTINUITY WITH, THE SPOKANE GLACIAL DRAINAGE PHENOMENA WHICH
ARE POSSIBLY PRE-WISCONS IN.
AND CRAB CREK ENTERED THE GRAND COULEE LINE OF DRAINAGE JUST

THIS MAGNIFICENT PLEXUS OF ANASTOMOSING ROCK-WALLED CHANNELS IS DNDOUBTEDLY THE WORK OF WATER
DISCHARGING FROM THE GRAND COULEE.
THE ROCK BARRIER OVER WHICH THEY FIRST FLOWED WAS FROM
DAS SET


1200 то 1275 A.T. .
THREE OF THE ENTERING CHANNELS WERE ERODED BELOW 950 WHILE THE LARGESt
WOOD WAS aT ITS HEIGHT.
CRAB CREEK SINCE THEN HAS NOT LOWERED #HE CHANNEL IT NOW OCCUPIES (THE
EASTERN ONE) ENOUGH TO SHOW ON THE MAP (25 FT INTERVAL)
AS EROSION BY THE GREAT STREAM
PROCEEDED, FAVORABLY SITUATED CHANNELS WERE CUT DEEPER AND PROBABLY WIDER, AND THE ORIGINALLY
LARGE NUMEER OF SMALL SHALLOW CHANNELS WAS GREATLY DECREASED.
THE FITTEST SURVIVED.
THE
HIGH SUX+A## TERRACE WAS GRADED WHILE THE SURFACE OF THE WATERS ENTERING THE TRACT WAS AT ABOUT
1050.
BUT THE THREE MAJOR CHANNELS MAY THEN HAVE BEEN AT PRESENT DEPTH AND THE WATER IN THEM
MAY HAVE BEEN 125 FEET DEEP. (SEE DEPTH OF WATER IN PRESENT DALLES LONG CHUTE)
THIS ISNT
PROBABLE, HOWEVER, FOR SINCE POST-GLACIAL DISCHARGE HAS NOT LOWERED THE CHANNELS PERCEPTIBLY,
THE MOSES LAKE-ROCKY FORD-WILLOW CREEK AND THE DISHAW (WINCHESTER QUAD) CHANNELS CAN NOT BE THE
RESULT OF POST-GLACIAL EROSION.
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED INTO THE HIGH TERRACE WHILE
THE CHANNELS WERE BEING ERODED IN THE BASALT.
A STRUCTURAL MOSES LAKE-WINCHESTER-OUINCY VALLEY MUST HAVE EXISTED BELFORE THE GRAND COULEE
DISCHARGED THE GLACIAL COLUMBIA ACROSS THE BADGER MTS.
WHETHER A DESSICATED BASIN OR WITH
DISCHARGE IS NOT KNOWN.
BUT WHEN THE GLACIAL FLOOD ARRIVED, SPILLAGE OCCURRED, APPARENTLY BY*
THREE ROUTES, ONE SURELY ACROSS THE EASTERN NOSE OF THE FRENCHMAN HILLS ANTICLINE, AND PROBABLY
AND PROBABLY TWO FOR A SHORT TIME BY WAY OF THE POTHOLES AND FRENCHMAN SPRINGS RE-ENTRANTS IN
THE OUINCY QUAD. A GREAT GRAVEL FILL WAS BUILT SOUTHWARD ENTIRELY ACROSS THE LOCAL GLACIAL
LAKE TO THE BARRIER, REACHING IT BY THE TIME THE WATER LEVEL IN THE SPILLWAYS ACROSS WAS DOWN
TO 1050. PERHAPS SEVERAL MINOR TERRACINGS IN THE HIGH TERRACE RECORD LOWERING OF THE LAKE
FROM 1275 TO 1050 WHILE THE FILL WAS EXTENDING ACROSS.
FURTHER DOWNCUTTING ALLOWED THE THREE
LOWER TRACTS (ML.,WC., DISHAW) TO BE FORMED, THE GRAND COULEE DISCHARGE ABANDONING THE DISHAW
FIRST AND THE WILLOW CREEK LAST. WHETHER THE GRAND COULEE CARRIED AS MUCH GRAVEL AS FORMERLY,
OR ANY AT ALL, ISNT KNOWN. CANTATSO DE BAAJ
IMMENSE QUANTITIES OF GRAVEL MUST HAVE GONE THRU THESE ROCK-WALLED RIVER CHANNELS. BUT
NONE LODGED, SO FAR AS SEEN. _HE CONSTRICTION AND THE GREAT DOLUME OF WATER CAUSED STRONG
CURRENTS WHICH KEPT THEM CLEAN. (THO IT DOES SEEM AS THO AT FINAL ABANDONMENT, SUCH DEPRESSIONS

AS GOOSE LAKE WOULD HAVE BEEN FILLED AT LEAST TO THE ENREL OF THE ROCK BÄRRIER.
PERHAPS THE
STREAMS THEN DIDNT CARRY MUCH GRAVEL. PERHAPS ABANDONMENT WAS VERY SUDDEN, WITH OPEMAGS. OF
DRAINAGE UNDER THE WANING OKANOGAN LOBE.
IT CAN BE CONCEIVED THAT THIS HUGE BLOOD CEASED IN

THE RELATIONS OFTHE BERGS WHICH CARRIED ERRATICS TO THESE GRAVEL TERRACES AND THESE CHANNELS
IS PUZZLING.
DID BERGS FLOAT ON THE GLAÇIAL MOSES LAKE?
WHY NOT, IF THE OKANOGAN LOBE THEN
WAS AT ITS MAXIMUM?
THEN ARE THERE ERRATICS IN THE GRAVEL?
NO SECTIONS TO SHOW. ARE THERE
ANY ON THE TERRACES? YES, UP TO THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE SUBMERGENCE ON THE HIGH TERRACE AND IN
MANY PLACES ON THE LOWER TERRACES.
gRE THERE ANY ERRATICS IN THESE CHANNELS AND ON THE BUTTES
AND ROCKY ISLANDS. YES, AT ALTITUDES UP TO AT LEAST 11504
A NEST OF THEM ALONG SECONDARY
ROAD EAST FROM FOOT OF GOOSE LAKE ON THE LARGE ISLAND BETWEEN GOOSE LAKE AND CRAB CREEK CHANNELS,
Err. AT ABOUT 925.
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED AFTER THE TERRACES WERE BUILL. AND IF STREAM
WATERS WENT OVER THIS LARGE SLAND IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT CHANNEL PLEXUS
AND IF THE TOP OF THIS ISLAND WAS SCOURED AND PERHAPS LOWERED BY EROSION, THIS NEST WOULD NEVER
HAVE PERSISTED.
TO THUS IT SEEMS CORRECT, AT PRESENT WRITING, TO PLACE THE COLUMBIA SUBMERGENCE
AFTER THE TERRACE-AND-CHANNEL DEVELOPMENT.


17
ANOTHER PUZZLE IS TO GET THE BERGS OVER GRAND FALLS IN GRAND COULEE.
PERHAPS THEY WOULD
TAKE THE PLUNGE SAFELY.
PERHAPS THE SUBMERGENCE BACKED THE WATERS UP OVER THE FALLS.
ALT.
OF LIP OF FALLS WILL SETTLE THIS.
PERHAPS THE FALLS DEVELOPED AFTER THE SUBMERGENCE SUBSIDED.
THE CHANNEL PLEXUS PROBABLY ANTIDATES THE SUBMERGENCE, BUT THE FALLS, HIGHER PROBABLY THAN THE
ITS LEVEL, MAY HAVE DEVELOPED AFTER THE SUBMERGENCE (VERY BRIEF) HAD SUBSIDED BUT WHILE GLA@@AL
WATERS WERE STILL RUNNING.
THIS IDEA DOES NOT HARMONIZED, HOWEVER, WITH THE SUGGESTION OF
ABRUPT DIVERSION OF THE GLACIAL COLUMBIA TO PRESENT ROUTE.
AGE OF THE PLEXUS IS WISCONSIN.
THIS FOODOWS FROM (1) - WISCONS IN AGE OF OKANOGAN LOBE,

aMT THE GRAND FALLS IN THE FLOOR OF GRAND COULEE IS NOT A SIMPLE FEATURE. IT IS MADE UP OF A
GREAT LEDGE OF BASALT, SOME 400 FEET ABOVTHE COULEE BOTTOM TO THE SOUTH, SEVERAL FLOWS BEING g
INVOLVED IN THE LEDGE. THIS LEDGE HAS A VERY IRREGULAR, CRENULATED MARGIN, CAUSED BY SEVERAL
PROMINENT AND MANY MINOR CHANNELS CUT BACK INTO IT BY SEPARAEE RECEDING FALLS OR PORTIONS OF THE
GREAT FALL.
THIS HAS GIVEN RISE TO HUGE BATTLEMENTED AND PALISADED SPURS AND BLADES PROJECT-
ING DOWN THE COULEE AT VARRING DISTANCE. A "DRY FALLS" IS AT THE HEAD OF THE LARGEST, MOST DEFINITE
AND MOST DEEPLY NOTCHED RE-ENTRANT CUT IN THE GREAT LEDGE. DO амтсмя Bixa amy 30 aou-aros
THE FACE OF THE GREAT LEDGE IS A SHEER DROP IN BUT FEW PLACES.
IN MOST PLACES, IT IS BROKEN
INTO LEDGES AND TERRACES, DETERMINED BY THESEVERAL FLOWS INVOLVED.
THE DIFFERENT CHANNELS AnD
THEIR FALLS ARE NOTCHED AT VARYING DEPTHS ON THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE LEDGE, ALSO.
THE WHOLE
ENSEMBLE WAS WeLl ON The WAy TO DISAPPEARANCE AS A UNIT WATERFALL AND TO TRANSFORMATION TO THE
DALLES TYPE OF RIVER CHANNEL AT THE TIME IT WAS ABANDONED. THE CHARACTER OF THE ROCK LEDGE
WAS NOT SUCH AS TO MAINTAIN THE NIAGARA TYPE OF FALL. PRISMATIC STRUCTURE ALLOWED EXCESSIVE
PLUCKING IN FAVORED PLACES, RAPID ENTRENCHING OF SMALLER, DEEPER CHANNELS, AND RAPID RETREAT OF
SMALER FALLS IN SUCH PLACES, AND ABANDONMENT OF OTHER TRACTS TO BECOME ROCK ISLANDS OR ROCK
SHALLOWS.
THERE IS NO NOTABLY WEAKER ROCK IN THE LOWER PORTION OF THE GREAT LEDGE THAN IN
THE UPPER, AND WERE IT NOT FOR THE PRISMATIC STRUCTURE, FALLS, IF ONCE INITIATED, WOULD NOT HAVE
PERSISTED AT ALL OVER THE LEDGE.
IF THE ABOVE CONCLUSIONS ARE CORRECT, THE QUESTION ARISES "HOW COULD THESE FALLS HAVE RE-
TREATED FORTHE 17 MILES WHICH ME INZER ASCRIBES, FROM SOAP LAKE AT MOUTH OF GRAND COULEE TO PRESENT
LOCATION?" THE ANSWER IS "THEY HAVE NOT RETREATED FOR WHAT DISTANCE HE FALLs TOOK
ORTAIN AT THE HEAD OFFReELAKE AND THE EASTERN PART, IN WHICH HAS OCCURRED THE MAXIMUM RECESSION,
DID NOT RETREAT EVEN 3 MILES. DRY FALLS IS AT THE HEAD OF THE LONGEST AND DEEPEST REENTRANT
AND PERHAPS RETREATED AS FAR, BUT NOT TO EXCEED 3 MILES. THE EVIDENGE FOR THIS NOTABLY DIFF-
ERENT INTERPRETATION IS FOUND IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE BASALT FROM THE HEAD oFFerdaaKE DOWN NEAR-
LY OR QUITE TO SOAP LAKE.

THE GRAND COULEE, IS NOT A SIMPLE GREAT GORGE BELOW COULEE CITY.
THE ORIGINAL SPILLWAY
WAS MUCH WIDER ON THE EAST THAN NOW.
AT ALTITUDES AVERAGING PERHAPS 500 FT ABOvE THE PRESENT
FLOOR ARE TYPICAL SPILLWAS CHANNELS, ANASTOMOSING, WITH BASALT BUTTES AND ISLANDS AMONG THEM, DEPTH
A FEW TENS OF REET UP TO 100 FT., IDENTICAL IN CHARACTER WITH THE SPILLWAYS SEEN ON THE BASALT

ABOUT 40 FT ABOVE LEVEL OF BLUE LAKE (ALKALI LAKERY ONE MILE NORTH OF BULLOCK'S RANCH. A GROUP
OF SMALLER BLORS (OR BRAGMENTS OF A LARGER ONE) WELL UP ON EAST SIDE, ON MATURELY ERODED SLOPES
ABOVE ALL SCOURED SURFACES, EAST OF MID-LENGTH OF ALKALI LAKE. THE ONE ON THE BRINK OF GRAND
FALLS IS TOO HIGH FOR THE SUBMERGENCE, SO FAR AS NOW KNOWN. PROBABLY LEFT BY A BERG WHICH
STRANDED ON THIS ISLAND.
THE ONE DOWN BY BLUE LAKE SHOWS THAT THE COULEE WAS ALREADY
EXCAVATED WHEN IT WAS DEPOSITED.
HE GROUP UP ON THE MATURE SLOPES SHOWS THAT THE SUBMERGENCE
FLOODED BACK OUT OF THE COULEE ON PRE-COULEE SURFACES.
ITS ALTITUDE WOURD BE SIGNIFICANT BUT
COULD NOT BE DETERMINED AT TIME OF TRAVERSE.
FROM SURVEY OF THE COULEE FROM HIGHER LAND TO THE EAST, IT APPEARS THAG THE MATURE SLOPES
(FIRST CYCLE EXTEND DOWN AT LEAST 2/3 OF THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ENTIRE CUT.
THIS ISNT
THIS THE GLACIAL SPILL OCOURRED. BUT THE LOWER ALTITUDE OF THE MATURE SLOBES OF THE EASTERN
SIDE STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE DEFORMARION, OR A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF IT, OCCURRED AFTER THE
MATURITY OF THE FIRST CYCLE, LIFTING THE OLD LAND TO THE WEST RELATIVE TO THAT OF THE EAST.
AN ALTICLINAL STRUCTURE CROSSES THE COULEE AT SOAP LAKE. STRUCTURE SHOWN IN BLUEFS OF THE
LAKE AND IN THE ELONGATED HILL (E-) EAST OF THE LAKE. A BROAD, WIDE VALLEY LIES NORTH OF THIS
ANTICLINAL HILL BETWEEN IT AND THE MAIN UPLIFTED REGION TO THE NORTH.
BUT NO SUCH LOW TRACT
ON THE WEST SIDE, NORTH OF THE LAKE. APPARENTLY THIS IS A CROSS FOLD ON THE GRAND COULEE
MONOCL I NE.
OR IT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A CONTINUATION OF THE BADGER MT UPFOLD (IF THIS MT IS

THE HEIGHT OF THE COUNTRY NORTH OF THE MOSES LAkE PLAINS IS LESS TO HE EAST OF GRAND COULEE X
THAN TO THE WEST OF IT. RUY YET THERE IS A RISE OF 200-300 FEET OR MORE. THIS UNDOUBTEDLY IS
STRUCTURAL AND INDICATES FURTHER BETAILS OF STRICTURE, YET TO BE WORKED OUT.
MORE IDEAS ON THE GLACIATION OF THE REGION. THE STRATFORD (CRAB CREEK) GRAVEL PLAIN, EXPOSED
IN SECTION AT ADRIAN, IS PRE-WISCONSIN. THIS FOLLOWS FROM THE OLDER CHARACTER OF ITS ASSOC-
IATED CHANNELS AND WE AMOUNT OF EROSION IT HAS SUFFERED. IT WAS BUILT OUT INTO THE MOSES
LAKE STRUCTURRL DEPRESSION.
SINCE IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE MERCY OF ALL AGENTS OF SUBABEIAL
EROSION FOLLOWING THIS PRE-WISCONSIN GLACIATION, AND SINCE THE VALLEY IN WHICH IT ENDED WAS
STRUCTURALLY ENCLOSED, IT FOLLOWS THAT BY THE TIME WISCONS IN GUACATION DEVELOPED, THIS PLAIN
AND THE VALLEY CONTAINING IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MODIFIED CONSIDERABLY BY EROSION.
IF THIS BE
TRUE, ANY ISOLATE PORTIONS APPROXIMATELY AT THE ALTITUDE OF THE STRATFORD PLAIN SHOULD BE
19 VI
PARTS OF THE ORIGINAl PRE-WISCONSIN PLAIN. TI)
a hair it
THE INTERPRETATION NOW FAVORED IS THAT THE STRATFORD PLAIN, THE CENTRAL HIGH GRAVEL MESA,
THE MOSES LAke P.O. TERRACE AND THE HIGH TERRACE WEST OF DISHAW CHANNEL ARE ALL PARTS ÖF THE


25
SAME ORIGINAL FILLING.
THE SOUTHWARD CONTINUATION OF THIS TERRACE REACHES THE DRUMHELLER
PLEXUS.
THEN ARE HE VALLEYS IN WHICH LIE MOSES LAKE AND ITS HORMS AND TRIBUTARIES IN LARGE PART
THE RESULT OF INTERGLACIAL EROSION?
TO ACCEPT THIS IS TO ADMIT THAT A NOTCH, OR NOTCHES,
WERE OUT AT THE DRUMHELLER PLEXUS BY ORDINARY RUN-OFF DURING INTERGLACIAL TIME.
BUT ALL EV I-
DENCE INDICATES THAT AN ENORMOUS FLOOD CUT THESE NOTCHES.
SIMILARLY, THE SAME FLOOD WATERS
ERODED THE BROAD CHANNELS IN THE HIGH PRE-WISCONSIN GRAVEL PLAIN.
WHAT GENTLE SLOPES THESE
FRAGMENTS OF THE PRE WISCONSIN PLAIN POSSESS WERE PRODUCED BY EROSION OF THE GRAND COULEE
TORRENTS ACROSS THE BUT LITTLE MODIFIED PRE-VISCONS IN PLAIN.
PROBABLY THErE WAs a CRAB CREEK
ROUTE BY WAY OF WILLOWCREEK, COMPARABLE TO THE PRESENT CRAB CREEK COURSE AT ADRIAN AND ABOVE.
PROBABLY THERE WAs A ROCKY FORD CREEK COURSE, AND PERHAPS A THIRD ENTERNCHMENT, FARTHER WEST,
HAD BEEN FORMED BY DRAINAGE OFF THE BADGER MTS.
ALL THESE WERE MODIFIED BY THE WISCONSIN
FLOODS, RESULTING IN THE DISHAW, RKY FORD, AND WILLOW CREEK CHANNELS.
ANOTHER CHANNEL THEN
FORMED, ApPARENTLY, IS THE WELL-WARKED AFFAIR NOW OCCUPIED BY CRAB CREEK DRAINAGE BETWEEN ADRIAN
AND SOAP LAKE.
ITS FLOOR IS MUCH HIGHER THAN SOAp LAKE, ABOUT THE ALTITUDE OF ADRIAN AND
SOAP LAKE STATIONS.
HOW MUCH OF THE GRAVEL IN THE MOSES LAKE REGION WAS CARRIED OUT THERE DURING WISCONSIN
OCCUPANCY OF GRAND COULEE?
HOW MUCH OF IT IS SIMPLY RE-ARRANGED PRE-WISCONS IN GRAVEL? DID
THE WISCONS IN WATERS ADD TO OR SUBTRACT FROM THE TOTAL VOLUME OF THE MOSES LAKE GRAVELS? DID
THE WISCONS IN GRAVEL ALL GO ON THRU THE CRAB CREEK AND GOOSE LAKE COUNTRY?; DRUMHELLER PLEXUS??
GRAVEL AT ADRIAN AND STRATFORD LIES IN THE SECOND CYCLE VALLEYS.
A PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE GRAVEL MESA AND THE TERRACE AT ARIAN IS THE GENTLE DOWN-SLOPE
TOWARD THE NORTH.
THE ONLY EXPLANATION, IF THESE TERRACES ARE EROSIONAL REMNANTS, IS THAT
SUCH LONG GENTLE SLOPES, IMPERCEPTIBLY GRADING INTO THE SUMMIT PLANES, ARE MATURELY GRADED.
IF THESE TERRACES ARE WISCONSIN IN AGE, THESE SLOPES MUST BE CONSTBUCTIONAL AND THE ONLY ADEQUATE
EXPLANATION NOW CONCEIVED IS THAT THEY ARE HE GRADED PROFILE OF THE BOTTOM OF THE HUGE STREAMS
WHICH HERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CONSTRICTED SOAP LAKE CHANNEL. IN SUCH A SITUATION, THE VELOCITY
OF THE WATER WOULD RAPIDLY DECREASE AS IT SPREAD OUT AND DEPOSITION TO MAKE A GRADED FLOOR WOULD
NO.d
PRODUCE A SURFACE SLOPING AGAINST THE STREAM.
HOW MUCH OF THE MATERIAL IN THE MOSES LAKE TERRACES CAN BE CONSIDERED GLACIAL OUTWASH, AND
HOW MUCH OS THE DEBRIS ROM THE EROSION FROM GRAND COULEE?
PROBABLY BY FAR THE LARGER PART IS
IF A AROR
FROM THE CUTTING OF THE COULEE.

HO BR NORTH FROM ADRIAN FOLLOWS "DRY COULEE" VIRTUALLY ALL THE WAy TO C.C.ME THIS "DRY COULEE"
IS A VERY PICTURESOUE AND INTERESTING GROUP OF GLACIAL DRAINAGE CHANNELS OUT IN BASALT. ALL THE
FAMILIAR PHENOMENA ARE HERE, AND THE GROUP DIFFERS FROM HE CHANNELS BETWEEN GRAND COULEE AND
SPOKANE ONLY IN BEING MORE DEEPLY INCISED, MORE OFF THE GRAND COULEE TYPE. BId
том Сот
cocoa


AND IN LARGE PART DRY COULEE IS BUT A PORTION OF GRAND COULEE.
AT LEAST THREE DEFINITE
ROCK-OUT CHANNELS LEAD OUT OF GRAND COULEE ON THE EAST AND CONVERGE INTO DRY COULEE.
THERE
ApPEARS TO BE ONE MORE ROCK CHANNEL WITH BORDERING SCABLAND, DRAINING FROM THE HARTLINE PLAIN
TO DRY COULEE GROUP.
AND IF THE HARTLINE PLAIN SHOULD PROVE TO BE GLACIAL OUTWASH OR
GRAND COULEE WASH, THE ENTIRE DRY COULEE SYSTEM WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED A PART OF THE GRAND
COULEE SPILLWAY.
IT IS CLEAR THAT AT AN EARLY STAGE IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE GRAND COULEE SOUTH
OF COULEE CITY, THE FLOOD OF WATERS WAS POURED OVER A WIDTH OF SEVEN MILES OF COUNTRY.
THERE
COULD NAVE BEEN NO PRE-EXISTING VALLEY OF NOTEWORTHY PROPORTIONS TO GUIDE AND CONCENTRATE
IT.
SCABLAND WITH SHALLOW CHANNELS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BETWEEN THERR AND GRAND COULEE, SOUTH
OF C.C., ATTEST THIS.
BUT FAVORED ROUTES WERE TRENCHED MORE DEEPLY AND THE WIDESPREAD FLOOD
WAs rESTRICTED TO A FEW CHANNELS.
EVENTUALLY, THE ROUTE ALONG THEMNONOCLINAL FLEXURE DESCRIBED
IN PRECEDING NOTES, TOOK PRECEDENCE AND WATERS WERE DRAWN DOWN FROM ALL THE OTHER CHANNELS.
PROBLEM
IF THE GRAND COULEE CARRIED PRE-WiSCONSIN WATERS, SHOULD NOT THESE HIGHER CHANELS
BE OF THAT AGE, AND ONLY THE DEEPER ONES BE THE PRODUCT OF THE WISCONSIN WATERS?
HERE OUGHT TO
BE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO SETTLE THIS OUESTION OF PRE-SCONS IN AND WISCONS IN DRAINAGE THRU THE
COULEE THAN THAT OFFERED BY THE GRAVEL TERRACES IN THE MOSES LAKE REGION
AND THE TALUS PILES
WILL ANSWER IT!!
MORE ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE GRAND COULEE REGION. NO THE MONOCLINAL FLEXURE AT COULEE
CITY IS TRULY A VERY UNSYMMETRICAL SYNCLINE, As IT IS AT ALKALI LAKE; EXCEPT THAT THE BEDS DO NOT
RISE AS HIGH TO THE EAST OF THIS TOWN AS THEY DO EAST OF ALKALI LAKE.
THE STEEPER WESTERN
LIMB (THE MONOCLINAL FLEXURE PROPER) WEST OF COULEE CITY IS DOUBLY FLEXED, A STRUCTURAL TERRACE
LYING PART WAY UP ON THE LONG SLOPE TO THE. HILL SUMMIT=1000 FEET ABOVE THE TOWN.
THE TREND OF THE FLEXURE CHANGES, MW OF COULEE CITY, TO NORTHEASTWARD AND EASTWARD, AND
CROSSES GRAND COULEE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT WALLED PORTION WHICH EXTENDS FROM A POINT 3 U
MILES NORTH OF THE TOWN TO THE COLUMBIA RIVER.
THE FLEXURE SHOWS WELL IN SECTION ON THE EAST
SIDE, THE FLOWS DIPPING 30° SOUTHWARD AND THE SURFACE OF THE REGION DESCENDING WITH THE STRUCTURE.
COULEE CITY IS BUILT ON THE FLOOR OF THE STRUCTURAL VALLEY IN AN UNDISSECTED PORTION. IT WAS H
THIS STRUCTURAL VALLEY WHICH SPREAD OUT THE SOUTHWARD-FLOWING WATERS TO FORM THE LARGE NUMBER
OF HIGHER SHALLOW CHANNELS, SOME TO DRY COULEE, SOME TO THE GRAND COULEE ROUTE. NONE OF THESE
Ay WEST OF THE PRESENT GRAND COULEE, FOR THE STEEPLY RISING BASALT THERE, CARRIED THE SURFACE

THE ARGUMENT FOR A RECEDING WATERFALL IN THE GRAND COULEE SPILLWAY CAN BE APPLIED BETTER
IN THE CRAMP COULEE $/ALINKX THAN TO THE LOWER, FOR HERE THE STRATA WERE HORIZONTAL ACROSS THE
GREAT GORGE. WO.BUT IF ONE EVER DEVELOPED IN THIS FAVORABLE PLACE, IT HAS ENTRRELY DISAPPEARED.

THE BIG GRAVEL TERRACE SCARP ON THE NORTH.
BUT ABOUT STRATFORD, THE VALLEY FLOOR IS A MILE WIDE

THE EXPLANATION IS CLEARLY THAT THE ADRIAN TERRACE IS WISCONSIN IN AGE AND THE GRAVELS ABOUT

AND ALMOST NOWHERE HAVE TALUS MORE THAN HALFWAY UP THE FACE.
IT LOOKED AT TIME OF TRAVERSE AS


THO SOME WISCONSIN DRAINAGE HAD SPILLED OVER FROM DRY COULEE OR GRAND COULEE AND HAD CLEANED OUT
THE LOWER PART OFTHE COULEE. BUT WHEN THE HEAD WAS REACHED, NEAR BACON STATION, IT WAS SEEN
THAT THE UPPER PART OF THE COULEE HAD NOT BEEN OCCUPIED BY WISCONSIN WATERS AND THAT THE DIVIDE
HAD NOT BEEN CROSSED BY SUCH DRAINAGE. FURTHERMORE, DEADMAN GULCH NEVER BROT IN /E/WISCONSIN

INSTEAD, CRAB CREEK VALLEY IS WIDE OPEN HERE AND THE FILLED PORTION BEGINS FARTHER WEST AT THE

(3) AT THE TIME OF SUCH INVASION AND BURIAL OF THE NORTH END OF THE COULEE BY GLACIAL
ICE, THE PONDED COLUMBIA MUST HAVE HAD SOME OTHER SPILLWAY. PERHAPS THIS WAS BM WAY OF ROCK
LAKE CHANNEL, SW OF SPOKANE, PERHAPS BY WAY OF HELLGATE TO WILSON CREEK. IOWA HE LATTER HARDLY TI
SEEMS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, FOR CRAB CREEK VALLEY (ABOVE STRATFORD) CONTAINS NO WISCONS IN GRAVEL FILL.
(4) THE GRAVEL CARRIED THRU GRAND COULEE DURING WISCONS IN OPERATION WAS NOT OF GREAT
DEPTH AT THE GRANITE RIDGE, ELSE THE GLACIATED SURFACES WOULD HAVE BEEN ETCHED ALONG THE STRUCT-
URALLY WEAKER ZONES AND PLANES.
IS IT NOT PROBABLE THAT THE GREAT VOLUME OF GRAVEL IN THE
MOSES LAkE TERRACES IS PRE WISCONSIN IN AGE, AND THAT WISCONSIN WATERS REHANDLED IT ONLY ENOUGH
TO GIVE TOPOGRAPHIC EXPRESSION? WAR IS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT MOST OF THE MATERIAL IN THESE GRAVELS
CAME FROM THE EROSION OF GRAND COULEE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEREFORE TOOK ORIGIN ALONG THE
LENGTH OF THE COULEE, LITTLE GRAVEL ENTERING, MUCH GRAVEL LEAVING? I THE LATTER OF THESE POSSIB-
ILITIES ALLOWS THE GRANITE RIDGE TO ESCAPE WITH MINIMOM ATTRITION, SINCE IT IS SO NEAR THE
HEAD OF THE COULEE.

HE ONLY WAY BY
WHICH THIS QUESTION OF CLOSURE OF THE GRAND COULEE AT MAxIMUM OF WISCONS IN GLACIATION CANSBE ANSWERED
IS BY EXAMINATION OF THE LOWEST SPILLWAYS OF THE SPOKANE GROUP, FROM MARSHALL SOUTH 00 ROCK LAKE.

THE INTERPRETATION OF THE HISTORY OF GRAND COULEE SEEMS CLEARLY TO INVOLVE A PRE-WISCONSIN
SPILL ACROSS A 2500-F00T SURFACE WHERE NO VALLEY EXISTED, THE FLOOD SPREADING OUT ABOUT 5 OR 6
MILES WIDE (3 MILES FOR THIS OLD SCOURED SURFACE AND 2 1/2-3 MILES FOR THE WIDTH OF THE COULEE.
SEARCHING OVER THE BASALT, THE FLOOD FINA&LY SELECTED THE WESTERN PART OFTIHE TRACT FOR DEEPER
TRENCHING AND THIS EASTERN PART WAS ABANDONED, NEVER AGAiN TO BE TOUCHED BY GLACIAL ICE OR GLACIAL
*WATERS. WITNESS THE UNDISTURBED TALUS ACCUMULATIONS. WISCONSIN ICE, IF IT REACHED THE
SUMMIT OF THE EASTERN BLUFFS OF THE COULEE, (2400+) DID NOT ENGROAOH ON THIS SURFACE TO ANY
EXTENT. No- did it wadus!


THE PRE-/ISCONS IN SPILL ERODED THECOULEE NEARLY OR QUITE TO PRESENT DEPTH.
PERHAPS BY
RECESSION OF FALLS AND CASCADES, INITIATED AT THE MONOCLINAL TRANSECTION NORTH OF COULEE CITY,
PERHAPS BY DOWN-CUTTING ALONG THE 30-MILE TA&#/ EXTENT FROM THE HEAD TO THE COULEE CITY STRUCT-
URAL VALLEY.
CERTAINLY THE VALLEY WAS AT PRESENT DEPTH WHEN THE WISCONSIN ICE OVERRODE THE
GRANITE HILLS IN THE COULEE.
SOME OF THE EXCAVATION MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED FROM THE FIRST WISC.
DIVERSION OF COLUMBIA RIVER TO GRAND COULEE TO THE TIME OF MASIMUM EXTENT OF WISCONS IN ICE.
CERTAINLY THE COULEE WAS CUT LOWER THAN THE PUK SPOKANE SPILLWAYS OR THE LINCOLN CO SPILLWAYS.
ELSE THEY AND NOT GRAND COULEE WOULD HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED WHEN THE WISCONS IN DAMMING OCCURRED.
AND SINCE THE BASALT SURFACE TRENCHED BY GRAND COULEE WAS ORIGINALLY ABOUT 2500 AT.T, AND THE
LOWEST LINCOLN OR SPOKE CO. SPILLWAYS ARE 2100+, THE COULEE MUST HAVE BEEN CUT BELOW THAT FIGURE
TO HAVE SECURED THE DRAINAGE.
THE REASON THAT THE PRE-WISCONSIN DISCHARGE EVER MADE A CHANNEL HERE IS THE SAME REASON
WHICH MUST BE USED TO EXPLAIN THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL PRE-WISCONS IN SPILLWAYS -THE PRE WISCONS IN
ICE CROSSED THE COLUMBIA IN SEVERAL PLACES AND HAD NO LONG EW VALLEY IN FRONT OF IT, ALONG
WHICH ALL ITS WATERS COULD MOVE TO THE LOWEST PASS.
THE SLOPES OF THE WALL DOWN TO THE COLUMBIA ARE GENTLER BY FAR ON THE AVERAGE THAN THE SLOPES
OF THE GRAND COULEE WALLS.
THEY ARE MORE GENTLE IN PLACES THAN THE SLOPES OF PRE WISCONSIN
GLACIAL DRAINAGE CHANNELS.

OKANOG^N LOBE HAS OVERRIDDEN THIS AREA AND THE ORIGINAL DALES CHANNEL FORMS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED A
BY BOTH EROSION AND DEPOSITION BY THE ICE.

"DR WS" OF NOT NOTABLE PROPORTIONS CONSTITUTE THE HEADWATERS OF MOSES COULEE DRAINAGE DIRECT-
LY EAST OF MANSFIELD. THEY MAY NOT BE DOWN TO BEDROCK. WHATERER THE HISTORY OF MOSES
COULEE PREVIOUS TO THE MAXIMUM OF WISCONS IN GLACATION, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT DURING THE ABLATION
OF THE OKANOGAN LOBE, NO NOTEWORTHY VALLEYS WERE FORMED BY ESCAPING GLACIAL WATERS ACROSS THE
GROUND MORAINE. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS NO PLACE APPARENT WHERE A PRE WISCONS IN MOSES COULEE
DRAINING SOUTHWARD, WOULD BE COMPLETELY OBLITERATED.
THE GLACIATED COUNTRY BETWEEN GRAND COULEE AND MANSFIElD And THaT ABOUT PILOT KNOB SHOwS
MANY GREAT BLORS OF BASALT AND BUT SEW, COMPARATIVELY, OF GRANITE. YET THE BERG-ORIFTED
ERRATICS SOUTH OF SOAP LAKE AND SOUTH OF QUINCY ARE NEARLY ALL OF GRANITE.
THIS SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE BERGS AND THEIR BURDENS DID NOT COME FROM THE OKANOGAN LOBE.
AFTER A SURVEY OF THE GREAT KNOBS OF SHEETED GRANITE, SOME OF THEM NEARLY AS HIGH AS THE COULEE
IS DEEP AnD WITH PRECIPITOUS SIDES, IN THE RANGE NORTH OF STEAMBOAT ROCK,, AND AFTER THE CONVIN-
CING EVIDENCE OF GLACAAL OVERRIDING OF MOST OF THESE KNOBS IS CONSIDERED, IT SEEMS VERY PLAUSIBLE
THAT THE BERG-BORNE BLORS WERE SECURED, IN LARGE PART AT LEAST, IN THE BED OF UPPER GRAND COULEE

(THE SYNCLINE FLOOR) IN WHICH THIS CHANNEL HAS BEEN FORMED BY WATERFALL RECESSION. BUT HERE
AND THERE ARE QTZITE AND GRANITE COBBLES AND PEBBLES UP ON THE SYNCLINAL FLOOR.
dal IT IS CLEAR, THEN, THAT WATERS FROM THE PRE-WISCONS IN GLACIATION SWEPT DOWN ACROSS THIS
DALLES TRACT IN GREAT VOLUME, FOUND NO DEFINITE, WELL-CUT STREAM VALLEY, SPREAD OUT WIDELY AND
INITIATED A LARGE NUMBER OF INCIPIENT CHANNELS. AS THESE DEEPENED, THE MORE FAVORABLY SITUATED

ONLY
IN THE BROAD, SIMPLE CANYON PORTIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS TRACT COULD GRAVEL BE DEPOSITED.
SINCE MOSES COULEE DRAINAGE DOES NOT HEAD MUCH NORTH OF THE LATITUDE OF MANSFIELD AND DID
NOT IN PREGLACIAL TIMES, ITS CLEAR THAT THE PRE-WISCONSIN ICE MUST HAVE ADVANCED AT LEAST As
FAR AS MANSFIELD IN ORDER TO DISCHARGE INTO THE COULEE.
THE WISCONS IN OKANOGAN LOBE HAS DES-
TROYED ALL EVIDENCE OF HIS EARLIER GLACIATION OF THE NORTHWARD PART OF DOUGLAs Co.

SWEPT AWaY, OR NEVER WAS DEPOSITED.
IF NEVER DEPOSITED, IT MUST BE CONSIDERED A DELTA TERRACE

VICINITY OF "THE POTHOLES!!
AUGUST 25 A 1922
THE POTHOLES CONSTITUTE THE BEST EXAMPLE MAPPED OF A RECEDING WATERFALL OVER HORIZONTAL
FLOWS OF BASALT.
THE ANCIEnT STREAM SPILLED OVER THE COLUMBIA CLIFFS AT AN ALTITUDE OF 1200
OR 1250.
THE CLIFFS WERE MADE UP OF TWO GREAT LEDGES, THE UPPER BLUFF ABOUT 200-250 FT HIGH
AND THE LOWER EQUALLY HIGH, IF NOT HIGHER.
BASE OF THEACLIFF IS NOW BURIED IN A gRAVEL
TERRACE AND ITS ORIGINAL HEIGHT CANNOT BE DETERMINED.
слонія
VISION
THE AMOUNT oF dAd$YON BECESSION IN THE TWO LEDGES IS QUITE UNEQUAL.
IN THE UPPER LEDGE
THE FALLS RECEDED NEARLY TWO MILES WHILE IN THE LOWER THERE ApPEarS 00 HAVE BEEN A SOMEWHAT
GREATER SPREAD OF THE WATERS OVER THE EDGE AND CERTAINLY WAS A LESSER OPPORTUNITY FOR SAPPING
AND PLUCKING.
THUS ONLY 1/4 MILES, MAXIMUM, OF RECESSION OCCURRED IN THE FIVE SEPARATE NOTCHES
WHICH WERE DEVELOPED.
THE UPPER FALLS WERE DOUBLE, OF ALMOST EQUAL PROPORTIONS. THEIR PARALLEL RECESSION
LEFT A GREAT BLADE OF ROCK, A MILE AND A HALF LONG, 1000 FT WIDE AND 375 FT MAX HEIGHT BETWEEN
THEM.
THE POTHOLES AT THE FOOT OF THE FALLS ARE LARGELY FILLED WITH GREAT GRAVEL BARS, THE
DEEPEST PORTIONS BEING AT THE FOOT OF THE FALLS.
ABOVE THE UPPER FALLS IS A CHANNELED TRACT EXTENDING TWO MILES FARTHER EST AND VERY MUCM
DIVERSIFIED BY RAMIFYING CHANNELS AnD THEIR SEPARATING ISLANDS. AN ISLAND STUDDED RAPIDS!
"HOLES" COMMON, SOME OF THEM 40 FEET DEEP IN THE BASALT.
OTHER PRELIMINARY CHANNELS, M^DE
BEFORE THE FALLS' HAD REACHED THEIR MAXIMUM RECESSION, EXIST ON THE SOUTH SIDE, ANGING ABOVE
THE CANNON PRODUCED BY RECESSION OF THE SOUTHERN FALL. ew HOtHm 25 ingra
TVATA
THE BASALT IN THE WALLS OF THE POTHOLES CARRIES A VERY COSPICUOUS MEMBER OF EXCEPTIONALLY
WELL-DEVELOPED AnD EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE COLUMNS. THESE COLUMNS ARE UNIFORM IN DIAMETER FROM
BOTTOM TO TOP AND IN PLACES ARE 75 FEET LONG.
THEY POSSESS PLATY PARTING ACROSS THE COLUMN
WHICH IS VERY CONSPICUOUS IN WEATHERED FACES. THIS PLATINESS CAUSES THIN SLABBY TALUS FRAGMENTS,
ALMOST CHIPS INSTEAD OF SLABS. @ THE TRUNCATED ENDS OF FALLEN OOLUMNS LOOK LIKE AN ADZED SURFACE
OF WOOD.
COMMONLY A COLUMN GOES ALL TO CHIRS WHEN IT FALLS. g
•TUa
SHIT
THERE IS AN EASTWARD DIP OF THE BASALT AT THE POTHOLES OF A FEW DEGREES.
IF THE EDGES
OF THE FALLS WAS HELD UP BY THE SAME LAYER DURING THE WHOLE OF ITS HISTORY, IT MUST HAVE BECOME
LOWER DURING ITS HISTORY. AS IT RECEDED.


39
AS THE SURFACE NOW STANDS, IT LOOKS AS THO THE ELONGATED POTHOLES HAD BECOME PROGRESSIVELY
DEEPER AND WIDER DURING RETREAT, BUT THIS IS BECAUSE THE WESTERN, EARLIER-FORMED PORTIONS HAVE
BEEN FILLED TO A GREATER EXTENT WITH GRAVEL. A MAXIMUM DEPTH OF 200 FEET OF GRAVEL LIES IN
THE SOUTHERN CHAnnEL.
MRVO
THE TALUS ACCUMULATIONS OF THE POTHOLES ARE SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR BUT THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY
CLIFFS WITH TALUS 3/4 OR MORE OF THEIR HEIGHT TO PERMIT THE HYPOTHESIS OF FORMATION BY WISCONSIN
WATERS.
TBE POTHOLES WERE FORMED AT THE TIME OF THE SPOKE GLACIAMMON. THE COLUMBIA.
VALLEY WAs ThEN AS DEEP OR NEARLY AS DEEP AS NOW.
NO THO THE LOWER LEDGE IS NOT MARKED BY
RETREATING FALLS IN A WAY AT ALL COMPARABLE TO THE OTHER, YET WATER CERTAINLY WENT OVER IT FROM
THE POTHOLES FALLS.
THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS MUST CONSIDER THAT THERE WERE TWO EPISODES
OF SPILLAGE OVER THE POTHOLES, THE FIRST WHEN THE COLUMBIA VALLEY FLOOR WAS AT THE LEVEL OF THE
LOWER LEDGE AND THE SECOND WITH A DEEPER COLUMBIA VALLEY AND A J/S SMALLER DISCHARGE TO MODIFY
THE NEWLY EXPOSED LOWER LEDGE. A BUT IF THE UPPER CHANNELS of +/#/ AND THE BIG FALLS ARE ORB
SPOKANE, THERE IS NOTHING IN THE ENTIRE REGION TO SUPPORT THIS IDEA OF A PRE-SPOKANE DISCHARGE,
GREATER THAN THAT OF THE SPOKANE EPOCH.
BMI SO NOATTASHT
THAT THE LOWER LEDGE IS PECULIARLY RESISTANT ANDTHE UPPER ONE LESS SO IS CLEAR IF ONE
STUDIES THEM BETWEEN THE POTHOLES AND TRINIDAD.
THEY ARE BOTH WELL SHOWN ON THE QUINCY QUAD.
THE UPPER CLIFF IN PLACES HAS RETREATED MORE THAN A MILE FARTHER BACK FROM THE COLUMBIA THAN THE
LOWER AND AVERAGES HALF A MILE FARTHER BACK. We AND THIS RETREAT ISNT MERELY A VAGARY OF RIVER
MEANDERING AT A CERTAIN STAGE IN DEVELOPING ITS VALLEY, FOR THE LOWER RESISTANT LEDGE SHOWS
ALSO AT THE TOP OF THE EASTERN WALL OF WILLOW SPRINS DRAW WHERE IT OCCUPIES A WHOLLY DIFFERENT
LEVEL (375 FT ABOVE ITS LEVEL AT THE POTHOLES AND A DIFFERENT RELATION TO THE TOPOGRAPHIC DEVEL-
OPMENT OF THE REGION.
HERE IT CONSTITUTES A HILLSIDE FEATURE, WELL ABOVE ALL POSSIBILITY OF
LATERAL EROSION EM THE COLUMBIA AT THE TIME THE SAME LEDGE WAS FLOODED NEAR THE POTHOLES.
EXAMNNATION OF ThE LEDGE IN THE FIELD SHOWS IT AS EXCEPTIONAL IN ITS WAY AS IS THE STRIKINGLY
COLUMNAR PART OF ME UPPER LEDGE ALREADY DESCRIBED. 00 THIS LOWER LEDGE IS CONPOSED OF AN EXCEP-
TIONALLY THICK FLOW, (MORE THAN 100 FT) WITH UNIFORMLY SMALL- COLUMNED BASALT FROM BOTTOM TO TOP.
SUCH A STRUCTURE APPARENTLY HAS NOT LENT ITSELF TO PLUCKING IN ANYTHING LIKE THE DEGREE TO WHICH
THe UpPER LEDGE HAs FEEN afFectEd. Haanwawoe anidhan weLlav
THERE IS STILL MORE OF INTEREST REGARDING THE LOWER LEDGE. HO DO IT RISES NORTHWARD NEARLY
400 FT IN FIVE MILES.
IN THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF QUINCY QUAD., THE SLOPES OF THE UPPER LEDGE
ARE COMPLETELY GrADED.
NO BED ROCK SHOWS.
HE SLOPES ARE RAVINED SO MUCH THAT THE EFFECT
OF A CLIFF OR MASSIVE LEDGE IS LOST. THEN FOR TWO MILES SOUTH OF THE ROAD UP FROM THE CRESGENT
BAR FRUIT RANCHES THE UPPER LEDGE BEARS TALUS TO THE TOP AND SOIL COVERS AND FILLS THE TALUS
TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT SAGE GROWS ALL OVER IT. ONLY HERE AND THERE DOES BEDROCK OUTCROP.
THIS PORTION OF THE UPPER LEDGE IS CONSIDERABLE YOUNGER #HAN THAT PORTION TO THE NORTH ABOVE
DESCRIBED BUT MUCH OLDER THAN THE SPOKANE EPOCH. NO WATER FROM THE COLUMBIA RIVER HAS FLOWED
OVER THE LOWER TERRACE TOP AND UNDERCUt The UPPER LEDGE HERE SINCE A MUCH EARLIER TIME THAN THE
ADMITIOU
SPOKANE EPOCH.
THEN FOR THE NEXT TWO MILES TO THE SOUTH (THE STRETCH EXTENDING TO THE POTHOLES) THE UPPER
LEDGE H§S TYPICAL POST-SPOKANE TALUS AND THE TERRACE TOP OF THE LOWER TERRACE IS GREATLY CHAN-
NELED AND ETCHED, WITH "HOLES" AND ROCK ISLAND IN PROFUSION AND COMPLEXITY.
THE MAP SHOWS
THE LARGER OF THESE BUT MOST OF THEM ARE NOT CAUGHT BY ANY CONTOUR.
THE COLUMBIA ENTERED


ON THE SURFACE OF THE LOWER TERRACE AT ABOUT 1200 A.T. IN SECTION 31, T 20N., R23E.
THESE FEATURES OF THE SURFACE OF THE LEDGE IN THE TWO MILES ABOVE THE POTHOLES APPEAR TO
BE OF SPOKE AGE. D SO DOES THE TALUS AGAINST THE UPPER CLIFF.
VET IT IS CLEAR THAT WHEN
THE SPOKANE DRAINAGE WENT OVER THE POTHOLES THE RIVER LEVEL WAs SOMEWHAT BELOW THE SURFACE
OF THE LOWER LEDGE AT THE POTHOLES. THE ONLY (?) HARMONIOUS INTERPRETATION OF THESE APPARENT
INCONSISTENCIES IS THAT THE CHANNELED SURFACE NORTH OF THE POTHOLES IS BUT SLIGHTLY OLDER AND
POSSIBLY THAT THE COLUMBIA VALLEY HA PREVIOUSLY BEEN CUT BELOW IT, THEN FILLED TO ITS LEVEL
WITH DEBRIS, AND THEN DURING THE SPOKANE EPOCH CLEANED OUT AGAIN, AT LEAST IN PART.
THE TWO MILE PORTION NORTH OF THE CHANNELED SURACE, AND SOUTH OF THE CRESCENT BAR ROAD,
BEARS CONSIDERABLE FINE RIVER GRAVEL, DISPOSED IN ROUNDED HILLS. NO GOOD TERRACE FORMS OR BAR
FORMS EXTANT, THO THE ROUNDED HILLS ARE PROBABLY THE RESULT OF SOFTENING DOWN OF THE ORIGINAL
BAR AND TERRACE FORMS. THIS GRAVEL DEPOSIT LIES IN FRONT OF THE PRE-SPOKE TALUS ABOVE DES-
CRIBED AND MUST BE CORRESPONDINGLY OLD.
IT SHOWS ONE THING CLEARLY THAT THE TERRACE TOP
HERE IS THE RESULT OF LATERAL PLANATION BY THE COLUMBIA AND NOT AN AFFAIR OF CLIFF RECESSION
UNDER THE ATTACK OF THE WEATHER AND REMOVAL OF DEBRIS BY SLOPE WASH.
IN SUMMARY, THE PROMINENCE OF THE LOWER LEDGE IS TO BE ASCRIBED TO THE PRESENCE OF A MORE
THAN USUALLY RESISTANT MEMBER OF THE BASALT FORMATION, COMBINED WITH THE PRESENCE OF A MORE
EASILY SAPPED MEMBER ABOVE, NOT TO SIMPLE MEANDER SWINGING WITHOUT CONTRASTS IN MATERIAL ABOVE
AND BELOW. A THE WARPING BY WHICH THIS TERRACE SURFACE RISES NORTHWARD WAS LARGELY COMPLETED
BEFORE THE SPOKANE EPOCH, ELSE THE RIVER WOUDD HAVE COVERED THE NORTHERN HIGHER PART.
THE
WHOLE TERRACE AND THE NEIGHBORING POTHOLES ARE PRE-WISCONS IN AND UNTOUCHED *ND UNTOUCHED BY
WISCONSIN FLOODS.
RELATION OF THE POTHOLES TO THE GRAND COULEE DRAINAGE.
AUG 26 1922
BEFORE THE SPOKANE EPOCH, THE MOSES LAKE STRUCTURAL VALLEY MUST HAVE CONTAINED A LAKE,
(HAVE SCHWENNESEN AND MEINZER FOUND ITS RECORD IN THEIR PLEISTOCENEFOSSIL SHELLS FROM WELL BORINGS)
WHOSE DISCHARGE WAy IS UNCERTAIN. DO - PERHAPS AN ALKALINE LAKE !
THEN An INDÚSPTABLE RECORD
SHOULD BE FOUND IN DEEP WELLS. A AT THIS TIME GRAND COULEE DID NOT EXIST AS A DRAINAGE LINE.
THERE WAS BUT AN INSIGNIFICANT STREAM VALLEY HEADING SOMEWHERE NEAR COULEE CITY AND DEBOUCHING
NEAR SOAP LAKE. TRANSECTION OF THE MINOR SOAP LAKE ANTICLINE DEMANDS A STREAM VALLEY HERE AT
THE TIME OF WARPING. 73030 AN
THEN CAME THE SPOKANE FLOODING, THEOVERFLOW AT THE NORTH END OF GRAND COULEE, THE EROSiON
OF MOSES COULEE AND GRAND COULEE, THE DEPOSITION OF ERODED MATERIALS IN THE MOSES LAKE/QUINCY
STRUCTURAL VALLEY, AnD DISCHARGE OVER THE POTHOLES AND THE OLD FALLS AT FRENCHIAN SPRINGS A FEW
MILES SOUTH, AnD PROBABLY AT THE DRUMHELLER PLEXUS.
THE CURIOUS FEATURE OF THIS LAKE DISCHARGE
WAS THAT TWO AND PROBABLY THREE OUTLETS WERE MAINTAINED LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW SUCH RECESSION As
B.T
THE POTHOLES SHOW AND SUCH PRE-VISCONS IN EROSION As UPPER GRAND COULEE SHOWS.
THE CONCLUSION
IS UNAVOIDABLE THAT THE FLOODS WERE LARGE, THE GRADIENTS STEEP, AND THE PLUCKING OF THE COLUMNAR
BASALT VERY RAPID.
EROSION OF HARD ROCK WITHOUT HIGH-AnGLE JOINTING, EVEN WITH STEEP GRADIENTS
AND LARGE VOLUMES OF WATER WOULD BE VERY, VERY MUCH SLOWBR.

KNAPP COULEE IS A NARROW CANYON WITH "HOLES IN ITS FLOOR FROM ITS HEAD DOWN TO 1440 AT
ITS GRADIENT MUST HAVE DETERMINED A HIGH VELOCITY STREAM, SIMILAR TO CHELAN RIVER TODAY. AT
1440 THIS NARROW CHANNEL FLOOR ENDS IN A GENTLY SLOPING FLAT, THO STILL WALLED IN BY PRECIPITOUS
SLODES.
THE FLAT IS CLEARLY A FILL IN THE ROCK-WALLED CANYON. BUT IN A SHORT DISTANCE
FARTHER THE FLAT ITSELF DIPS DOWN THE PALLEY WITH AS HIGH A GRADIENT AS THE SCOURED CHANNEL ABOVE.
THIS CONTINUES TO ABOUT 1000 A.T., BELOW WHICH THE VALLEY ENDS, HANGING ON THE WALLS OF THE
MASTER VALLEY. A FURTHER DESCENT OF ABOUT 300 FEET BY A VERY TORTUOUS ROAD DOWN THE FACE OF
THE COLUMBIA VALEY CLIFF BRINGS ONE TO THE RR LEVEL. BISLA
INTERPRETATION MADE AT HEHE TIME OF THE EXAMINATION WAS THAT THE LAKE SPILLED THRU THE YELUJAV
COULEE IN A FASHION SIMILAR TO ITS PRESENT SPILL DOWN CHELAN RIVER, BUT THAT AT 1440 THE DISCHARGE
ENTERED STANDING WATER WHICH BACKED IN FROM COLUMBIA VALLEY.
DEPOSITION IN THE PRE-CHELAN
HILLSIDE BORGE WHICH THE COULEE ENTERS TOOK PLACE AT AND BELOW THIS STANDING WATER LEVEL AND
PRODUCED THE STEEPLY SLOPING FILL.
THIS STANDING WATER COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN THE COLUMBIA
FAT
SUBMERGENCE.
IT MUST HAVE OCCURRED WHILE THE OKANOGAN LOBE STILL BLOCKED THE MOUTH OF CHELAN
VALLEY PROPER AND FORCED DISCHARGE THRU KNAPP COULEE. THIS DATES THE SUBMERGENCE As OCCURRING
DURING THE EARLY WAINS OF THE WISCONSIN GLACIATION. IT IS. PREVIOUS TO THE BLDG OF THE GREAT
TERRACE AND ITS CORRELATIVE TERRACES FARTHER DOWN THE VALLEY. THIS, ACCORDING TO PARDEE, OCCURRED
AFTER THE WISCONSiN iCE HAD RETREATED TO OMAK, AT WHICH TIME THE SUBMERGENCE HAD LOWERED, THE
OKANOGAN LOBE HAD DISAPPEARED, AND THE CHELAN DISCHARGE HAD FOUND ITS PRESENT ROUTE.
SINCE THE
MOSES LAKE TERRACES ARE THE RESULT OF GRAND COULEE OPERATION, AT TIME OF DAMMING OF THE COLUMBIA
BY THE OKANOGAN LOSE, THEY ARE OLDER THAN THE GREAT TERRACE AND CORRELATIVES (THE COLUMBIA VALLEY
TRAIN) •
FURHRER CONFIRMATION IS FOUND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BERG-CARRIED ERRATICS ON THE MOSES
LAKE TERRACES BELOW 1250 OR SO, AND THEIR ABSENCE ON THE COLUMBIA VALLEY TRAIN.
THE WISCONS I NY wATerBOdY BAcK OF gRAnD COULEE SHOULD BE MAPPED AND NAMED.
ITS EXTENT CAN
BE DETERMINED BY USING THE 1500 (ApPROx) CONTOUR FROM GRAND COULEE EASTWARD ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF

HERE, THEN IS THE EVIDENCE, CLEARLY PRESENTED, THAT THE FLAT TRACTS AMONG THE HILLS WERE
ALREADY THBBE (((LATER-QUITE WRONG))) And ThaT THE LOWER ONES ONLY WERE USED AND WERE MODIFIED
BUT SLIGHTLY IN THIS REGION BY GLACIAL DRAINAGE.
THE FIRST CYCLE HILLS WERE NOT HERE WHEN
THE SPOKANE GLACIATION OCCURRED, AND THEIR ABSENCE CANNOT BE ASGRIBED TO SCOUR OF THE SPOKANE


WATErS.
TO SEE THE EROSIVE ACTION OF GLACIAL WATERS IN FULL MEASURE, AN AREA WITH HIGHER
GRADIENTS MUST BE EXAMINED.
FOR EXAMPLE GRAND OR MOSES COULEES.

BE THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS WORK IN THE SPOKANE DISTRICT • GLACIAL WATERS OUT DOWN JUST As
DO ORDINARY STREAMS, THEY DIDNT SPREAD WIDELY AND ERODE LATERALLY MORE THAN THE AMOUNT SHOWN IN

TRAVERSE WADE TO LEARN IF ANY WISCONS IN WATER EVER WEST OUT/THRU THE SPOKANE SPILLWAY GROUP.
ALTITUDE ACROSS THE SCOURED TRACT NOWHERE 50 FEET BELOW THAT OF CHENEY AND NOWHERE IS THERE A
SIGN OF ESCAPING GLACIAL WATERS SINCE THE SPOKANE EPOCH.
IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE, FROM WHAT IS
KNOWN OF THE CHARACTER OF THE SPILLWAYS FARTHER WEST THAD THE ONLY WISCONS IN DISCHARGE ROUTES WERE
GRAND COULEE, NOSES COULEE AND THE COLUMBIA BELOW CHEMAN.
AS WHEN THE OKANOGAN LOBE ADVANCED
INTO THE HEAD OF GRAND COULEE AnD GLACIATED THE GRANITE KNOBS AND HILLS THERE, WATERS FROM THE
PONDED COLUMBIA TO THE EAST MUST HAVE KEPT AN ESCAPEW^Y OPEN UNDER, THRU OR OVER THE ICE.
PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THE EASTERN GRAWITE OUTCROPS IN THE COULEE ARE NOT GLACIATED.
THE STREAM
WAS CROWDED TO THAT SIDE BY THE DEPLOYING OLANOGAN LOBE FROM THE WEST BUT MAY BE AsSUMED TO HAVE
KEPT AN OPEN CHANNEL HERE. DO
THE MOST PRONOUNCED OF THE CHANNELS IN THE VICINITY OF CHENEY IS THAT IN WHICH FARRINGTON
(FISH) LAKE LIES.*
THIS CHANNEL PORTION IS WELL SEEN FROM ANY OF THE TRARE RAILROADS ENTERING
SPOKANE FROM THE SI.
BUT THE MARKED CHANNEL CHARACTER CEASES NEARER CHENEY AnD THE BOTTOM OF
THE SPILLWAY SOUTHWARD IS ABOUT 50 FEET HIGHER.
THIS IS SIMPLY ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION OF THE
EXCAVATION OF"HObES" IN THE BOTTOM OF A BIG STREAM OVER JOINTED BASALT.
SOME GLACIATED QTZITE BLORS AND MANY GRANITES 2/ As MUCH AS 8 FT IN DIAMETER LIE ON THE
BASALT PLAIN AT 2450 TO 2500 BETWEEN THIS DRAIN^GE TRACT AND THE EMPIRE HIWAY TO THE EAST.
SURELY THIS SURFACE OF THE BASALT HAS BEEN GLACIATED. JO THESE BLORS ARE TOO LARGE AND ANGULAR
TO HAVE RODLES/IN STREAM, AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS PART OF THE B^SALT WAS FLOODED BY
THE SPOKANE GLACIAL WATERS.
BUT CAN WE BB SURE THAT THEY WERE DEPOSITED BY THE SPOKANE ICE
AnD NOT THE CHENEY ICE.
THE PROBABILITIES ARE ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT INTERPRETATION, BUT THE
CASE ISST CLINCHED YET. Of
THERE IS ONE HILL OF ThE PALOUSE TYPE RISING ABOVE THE BASALT PLAIN (BROWNS BUTTE) TO THE
NORTH WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN OVERRIDDEN WHEN THE ICE LEFT THESE OTZITE AND GRANITE BLORS HERE.
SINCE IT IS A CLEAR CASE OF THIS, IT SHOULD BE EXAMINED IN DETAIL 6O SEE
(1) IF A CHARACTERISTIC SHAPE HAS BEEN GIVEN IT,
(2) IF TILL LIES AT OR NEAR THE SURFACE,
STDART
(3) IF LOESS COVERS THE TILL,

CRESTON TO PEACH TO DAVENPORT AUG 29 1922 8 ит 46
A LARGE GRANITE BLORS, MAX DIA, 8 FT. ALONG SUNSET HiWAy EAST OF CRESTON.
ALSO LARGE BLOR
OF IMPURE SILICIFIED LIMESTONE. 3 SMALLER ONES OF A GREAT VARIETY OF IGNEOUS AND METAMORPHIC
ROCKS SCATTERED ALL THE WAY TO PEACH. SOIL IS THIN, MUCH SCABROCK, BASALT CLOSE TO SURFACE,
NO TILL IN ANY CUTS.
THE COUNTRY NORTH OF CRESTON IS A PLAIN OF BASALT, NO FIRST CYCLE HILLS.
HAS A SCRUBBED AppeARANCE BUT NOT ETCHED IN CHANNELWAYS AND ISLANDS.
THE NORTHWARD PORTION OF THIS PLAIN IS DEEPLY GASHED BY HAWK CREEK, INDIAN CREEK AND THEIR
TRIBUTARIES.
THE SCRUBBED-OFF PLAIN OF BASALT WITH MUCH SCABROCK AND MANY SCATTERED GLACIAL
ERRATIOS ALSO ABOUT THE HEAD OB INDIAN CREEK (ENTERS HAWK FROM THE EAST). ANOTHER SIMILAR
TRACT, FLANKED ON SOUTH, EAST AND WEST, BY FIBST CYCLE HILLS AND BEARING SEVERAL FEET OF COARSE
GRAVELLY DEBRIS AT LORENE 6-7 MILES NORTH OF DAVENPORT.
MUCH FOREIGN MATERIAL AT LORENE ALSO.
THESE FLAT TRACTS ON THE BASALT ARE A PUZZLE I IT IS BELIEVED, HOWEVER, THAT THEY ANTEDATE THE
SPOKANE GLACIATION AND ARE A FAVORING CONDITION, RATHER THAN A RESULT, OF THE GLACIAL OR FLUVIO
GLACIAL AcTION WhiCH SPRedD ThE ERrATIC MATERIAL OVER THEM NORTH OF CRESTON AND ABOUT LORENE.
NO FACETTED OR STRIATED STONES WERE FOUND ANYWHERE ON THEM 9A310 SE
THE LORÉNE TRACT HAS A GRAVEL PIT BUT THE SIDES HAVE BECOME COVERED WITH LOOSE MATERIAL AND
NO SECTIONS NOW ARE VISIBLE. IN THE BOTTOM OF THIS PIT WERE FOUND FRAGMENTS TWO FEET IN DIA.
OF A BRINK RED-TO-YELLOW-TO-WHITE CLAYEY MATERIAL CONTAINING ANGULAR PIECES OF GRANITE AND BASALT,
THE BASALT PERFECTLY FRESH THO THE CLAY IS VERY MUCH DECAYED, THE CLAY LOOKS LIKE THE RESIDUUM
OF GRANITE, CONTAINS MICA AND APPARENTLY MUCH KAOLIN.
WHEN FIRST FIRST FOUND, IT WAS THOT TO
BE AN EXTREMELY WEATHERED TILL BUT THE FRESH BASALT IN IT SEEMS TO RULE OUT THIS HYPOTHESIS.
AND THE PREFERRED HYPOTHESIS IS RENDERED MORE PROBABLE SINE LOW GRANITE HILLS LIE IMMEDIATELY
TO THE S CUTH AND THE DRAINAGE OF THEIR NORTHERN SLOPES GOES BY WAY OF LORENE.
[HE FOREIGN MATERIAL, ABUNDANT ENOUGH ON THE FLAT TRACTS NOTED, IS TOTALLY ABSENT FROM THE
FIRST CYCLE HULLS WEST OF LORENE (4 MILES TRAVERSE OF THEM) AND BETWEEN LORENE AND DAVENPORT.
THERE Are NUMeROUS ROAD CUTS 6 TO 10 FEET DEEP, ALONG THE ROUTE AND NOTHING IS EXPOSED SAVE THE
YELLOW-BROWN LOESS AnD A FEW SHOULDERS OF DECAYED GRANITE IN SITU BENEATH THE LOESS. EITHER THE
FOREIGN MATERIAL IS ABSENT OR IT IS COVERED BY LOESS.
IF COVERED, THERE SHOULD BE HERE AND THERE
SOME STRAY FRAGMENTS SHOWING. FURTHERMORE, EVIDENCE COLLECTED DURING THIS FIELD SEASON STRONG-
Ly INDICATES THAT THE LOESS IS OLDER THAN THE SPOK^NE AND WISCONSIN GLACIATIONS AND HAS SURER-
ED EROSION MORE RAPIDLY THAN IT HAS ACCUMULATED IN POST-SPOKANE TIME.
THE PREFERRED INTERPRETATION OF THE GLACAL ERRATICS SCATTERED ON THE BASALT PLAIN IS THAT
FLOOD WATERS OF THE SPOKE SPOCH, DISCHARGING BY WAy OF HELLGATE AND WILBUR, BACKED UP OVER THE
PLAIN BUT BID NOT FLOOD THE VALLEYS AMONG THE HIGHER FIRST CYCLE HILLS.
IT MAy BE POSSIBLE,
HOWEVER, THAT THE SPOKANE ICE PUSHED OVER ON THE PLAIN TRACTS, PERHAPS As FaR As CRESTOn.
THE
TALUS ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HEADS OF THE RAVINES 3-4 MULES NORTH OF CRESTON APPEAR OLDER THAN IN
THE SPOKANE SPILLWAYS OF NORTH CENTRAL WASHINGTON.
THIS, HOWEVER, MAY BE DUE TO ACCUMULAtiON
ON ROCK SLOPES, INSTEAD OF AT THE FOOT OF VERTICAL CLIFFS.
NO CLIFFS OF THE GLACIAL SPILLWAy
SORT ARE TO BE EXPECTED HERE.


THE TRACT OF LOW GRANITE HILLS NORTH OF DAVENPORT RISES PERHAPS 100 FT ABOVE THE GENERAL
LEVEL OF THE HILL TOPS OF THE BASALT FIRST CYCLE TOPOGRAPHY.
HE MATURE TOPOGRAHY, HOWEVER,
GOES COMPLETELY ACROSS, NOT DIFFERENT IN ANY ESSENTIAL FROM THAT ON THE BASALT. AND THE LOESS IAL
SOIL, IDENTICAL IN APPEARANCE (?) IS ON GRANITE AND BASALT ALIKE. THE TRACT UNDERLAIN BY GRAN-
ITE IS SEVERAL MILES WIDE AnD ISLANDS LIKE IN SITUATION IN THE BASALT.

WE PARDEE"S NESPELEM SILT LIES IN TERRACE FRAGMENTS AND HILLS IN HAWK CREEK AND INDIAN CREEK®
VALLEYS, FOR 6 OR 7 MILES BACK FROM THE COLUMBIA. MO THERE IS VERY LITTLE TRUE LAKE OLAY IN IT.
IT IS PREVAILINGLY OF SAND AND CLAYEY SAND, WITH SOME GRAVEL. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO GRADATION
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS OCCUR IRREGULARLY ALL AT ALL HORIZONS. IT MUST BE IN
SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE RIVER. ON NORTH SIDE OF THE COLUMBIA AT pEACH, IT CONSTITUTES
A FINE TERRACE SHARPLY TERMINATING AGAINST GRANITE CLIFFS AND WITH SHARP EDGE OF FLAT AND SCARP:
TOWARD THE RIVER. A

AT NOTHING WHICH COULD BE CALLED SEASONAL BANDING WAS FOUND IN THE OLAY. IN SOME SECTION (aM
(HERE ARE MANY GOOD ONES ALONG THE OLD R GRADE) THERE IS AN ALTERNATION OF SAND AND CLAY LAYERS
EACH NOT TO EXCEED 3 FEET IN THICKNESS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE SAND IS /THE RECORD OF SUMMER ONUS
MELTING AND THE CLaY OF WINTER CLEARING OF SHALLOW PONDED WATERS. IF THE NESPELEM SILT IS A
RECORD OF THE WISCONSIN FLOODING, IT SEEMS TO RECORD A GRADUAL RISING OF THE WATER, AND A RATE
OF SEDIMENTATION WHICH KEPT pACE WITH IT. 19 NOT A LAKE, SO MUCH AS A BBOAD RIVER FLAT, APPEARS on
ON THIS INTERPRETATION TO HAVE LAIN BACK OF THE OKANOGAN ICEDAM !!!
THE TERRACES IN THE MAIN
COLUMBIA VALLEY ALSO APPEAR TO / BE FRAGMENTS OF A COMPLETE FILLING, ONCE 00CUPYING THE COL-
UMB A UP TO THEIR LEVEL.
THE NESPELEM SILT CLEARLY IS OF GLACIAL ORIGIN. MO THE OLAY IS A LIGHT COLORED ROCK FLOUR,
IMPALPABLY FINE, AND WHOLLY FREE FROM BITS OF MICA WHICH SHOULD BE PRESENT In IFY WERE A CLAy
DERIVED FROM EROSION OF BESIDUAL SOILS. BO AND THERE ARE COBBLES AND EVEN BLORS IN THE DEPOSIT,
BRUISED AND STRIATED AND OBVIOUSLY NEVER ROLLED AFTER RELEASE FROM GLACIAL ICE. THEY MUST HAVE
FLOATED IN ICEBERGS OR FLOES TO THEIR PRESENT LOCATION.

THE

SHOW NO SPOKANE DISCHARGE, AND POTHOLES SHOW NO WISCONS IN.
INTERPRETATION IS THAT
INTERGLACIAL WARPING OF SLIGHT AMOUNT LOWERED DRUMHELLER TRACT AND RAISED POTHOLES TRACT
SUFFICIENTLY TO DIWERT THE LATTER DISCHARGE TO THE YOUNGER SPILLWAY.
