BROWNS BUTTE AND LATAH CREEK SPOKANE CO. JULY 20 1923
BROWNS BUTTE IS A QTZITE HILL PROJECTING THRU THE BASALT. A FEW LEDGES PROJECT THRU THE
SOIL BUT IT IS LABELY MANTLED WITH SOIL. NOT A PALOUSE HILL. ON SUMMIT OF SADDLE EAST OF
FARM HOUSE ON WEST SLOPE IS A GRANITE PORPHYRY BLDR AND TWO BASALT BLDRS.
BUT NO OTHER TRACE
OF GLACIAL DRIFT SEEN, THO NO EXTENSIVE EXAMINATION WAS MADE. THESE ERRATICS ABOVE 2500, BELOW
2600. GR^VEL PIT ON INLAND EMPIRE HIWAY AT NORTH BASE OF THE BUTTE, ALT. ABT2400, IS IN AN UNUSUAL
DEPOSIT OF ANGULAR QTZITE DEBRIS, MOSTLY PEBBLE SIZE, WHOLLY UNWORN, POORLY SORTED BUT STRATIFIED,
WITH SOME FORESET BEDS DIPPING UP LATH CREEK VALLEY. IN THE GRAVEL ARE GRANITE, GABBRO, BASALT
AND PORPHYRITE IN COBBLES OR SMALL BLORS.
ALSO À FEW WELL WORN QTZITE PEBBLES. THIS DEROS IT
PROBABLY DUETO GLACIAL WATERS MOVING SOUTHWARD.

TOPOGRAPHY OF BASALT

MOST OF THE PRAIRIE IS
IRREGULARLY UNDULATING.
LITTLE IN THE WAY OF FLATS AND BLUFFS TO EXPRESS THE FLOW STRUCTURE
OF THE BASALT.
NO SCABLAND.! MOST PRONOUNCED BLUFFS AND ABANDONED CHANNEL SEEN ON
TRAVERSE FROM BROWNS BUTTE TO MARSHALL IS ABOUT A MILE WEST OF THE BUTTE.
THE LARGEST
ERRATICS SEEN ARE BETWEEN THE BUTTE AND THIS CHANNEL, ABOUT 2400 AT. T THEY ARE GRANiTES,
LITTLE AFFECTED BY WEATHERING,

PARADISE PRAIRIE, LIKE SUNSET, FIVE WILE, ETC. BEARS A GROUND MORAINE SOIL APPARENTLY, AND
WAS LITTLE AFFECTED BY ESCAPING GLACIAL WATERS. HENCE ABSENCE OF SCABLAND.
BUT WHY NOT AFFECTed WHEN ICE WAs ADVAnCINg TO THIS AREA AnD RETREATING FROM IT??? APPAR-

SLOPE OF FRONT 20°. BEDDING PARALLELS THE SLOPE AND ApPARENTLY
DETERMINES IT. TOP OF DELTA IS NOT LEVEL BUT RISRS TO N.

IQ NOT A LARGE DELTA
BUT CLEARLY PRODUCED BY GLACIAL WATERS FROM THE NORTHWEST.
NO GOOD CHANNEL SEEN ON THE UPLAND
HOWEVER.

IF DURING ADVANCE TO SPANGLE, IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLITERATED OR GREATLY
MODIFIED.
I ALSO WOULD HAVE A BRINK (IF NOT DESTROYED). AT ALTITUDE OF NORTH PINE CREEK COL AT
BEGINNING OF ITS OPERATION AS SPILLWAY.
ALTITUDE WILL SETTLE THIS.
A LARGE GRANITE ERRATIC ON THE 3° SLOPE, NOT FAR FROM BRINK.
CUE PLAIN BETWEEN MARSHALL AND THE HILLS NORTH OF CHENEY IS DETERMINED BY THE UPPER SURFACE OF
THE BASALT.
NO TRACE OF HIGHER LEDGES ON FLANKS OF THESE HILLS.
PLAIN BEARS MORE SOIL THAN
PARADISE PRAIRIE (BUT A POORER SOIL); AT LEAST THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO BASALT OUTCROPS. NO
SUGGESTION OF CHANNELS.
ApPARENTLY NEVER A ROUTE OF ESCAPING AX/ALERODING GLACIAL WATERS.
VARIOUS KINDS OF AL/ GRANITOIDS ALL OVER IT, BUT NOT ABUNDANT. TOPOGRAPHICALLY IT IS A SE
EXTENSION OF SUNSET PRAIRIE.
04 19 70
HILL NORTH OF BONSER SCHOOL IS GRANITE.
TTS SOIL FULL OF FINE, ANGULAR GRANITE DEBRIS.
NOT A BASALT, QTZITE OR OTHER KIND OF ROCK FOUND ON IT. APPARENTLY NEVER COVERED BY BLACIAL
ICE, AT LEAST SPOKANE ICE.
NO LEDGES OF GRANITE EXCEPT AT NORTH BASE WHERE ICE PROBABLY RUBBED
OFF THE RESIDUAL SOIL.
THIS SOIL COVERING THE HILL COULD NOT HAVE REMAINED OF ICE HAD PASSED
OVER IT, AND COULD HARDLY HAVE FORMED SUBSEQUENT TO THE SPOKANE GLACIATION. A FEW RATHER SHARP
KNOBS ON SUMMIT, WHICH 10E WOULD HAVE RUBBED OFF, OR RUBBED BARE AT LEAST. JAY
YET A COMPARISON OF THE RESIDUAL SOIL ON THE GRANICE HILLS AT MICA WITH THAT ON THE BONSER
HILL IS INSTRUCTIRE.
DECOOPOSITION HAS DESTROYED ALL ORIGINAL SILICATES AT MICA.
ONLY THE
CHALKING OF FLOSPRS HAS OCCURRED AT BONSER HILL.
FITHER THE GRANITE IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN
CHARACTER OR THE BONSER HILL HAS BEEN RUBBED OFF BY GLACIAL ICE. THE FIRST SUGGESTION OS OF
LITTLE VALUE FOR IT IS A MATTER OF FELDSPAR DECOMPOSITION, NOT GRANITIC ODS INTEGRATION, WHICH
MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN MANTLE ROCK.
MOST SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION NOW SEEMS TO BE THAT GLACIAL ICE HAS BEEN OVER THIS HILL.
BUT NO ERRATICS REMAIN TO TELL THE STORY, WHILE THEY ARE FREQUENTLY FOUND ONER THE PLAIN TO
THE WEST, NORTH AND EAST.
AND THE GRANITE HAS CRUMBLED TO A MANTLE WHILE NO GRANITE ERRATICS
ARE SO ALTERED
THE GLACIAL ICE, THEREFORE, WAS THE CHENEY ICESHEET, WHICH IS BELIEVED AT
PRESENT TO BE OLDER THAN THE PALOUSE HILLS TOPOGRAPHY, WHICH IN TURN IS OLDER THAN THE SPOKAnE
MANO EY
GLACIATION.
A PIT OPENED ON BASE OF SOUTHWEST SIDE OF THIS HILL, NEAR MEADOW LAKE-MARSHALL ROAD, EXPOSES
POORLY SORTED, VERY LITTLE WORN, STRATIFIED GRANITIC DEBRIS, WITH PLENTY OF BASALT, GRANITE,
QUARTZITE, ETC.
THE GRANITIC MATERIAL IS A GRAVEL IN TEXURE BUT WHOLLY ANGULAR, IDENTICAL
WITH THAT ON THE SLOPES TODAY.
SINCE THE DEPOSIT WAS MADE BY SPOKANE WATERS, THE HILL THEN
BORE A MANTLE LIKE IT DOES TODAY, FROM WHICH THIS DEBRIS WAS DERIVED.
ONLY THE BASAL PORTION
OF THE HILL WAS REACHED, HENCE BARE LEDGES OF GRANITE ESIST OULY. THERE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE
HILL IS STILL MANTLED.

THE TALUS SLOPES
ARE DEFINITELY AS OLD AS SPOKANE. A LOWEST CHANNEL IS 200 FT ABOVE THE RIVER SURFACE, 500 FT
A.T.
THUS THE COLUMBIA WATERS SINCE THE SPOKE EPOCH HAVE MEVER FLOWED 200 FT HIGHER
THAN THEY DO TODAY. NO GRAVEL FILL HAS EVER RAISED THE RIVER LEVEL THAT MUCH HERE.
THE ABOVE CONCLUSION SEEMS UNESCAPEABLE IF THE TALUS IS SPOKANE.
YET AT THE MOUTH OF
JUNIPER CANYON IS A FRAGMENT OF A TERRACE, COMPOSED LARGELY OF LOCL BASALT, SUBANGULAR, BUT ALSO
CONTAINING SOME GRANITE COBBLES. A THIS TERRACE SHOULD BE A PORTLAND DELTA AFFAIR. ITS
UPPER SURFACE IS 450 FT. A.T., ONLY 50 FEET BELOW THE FLOOR OF THE LOWEST CHANNEL ABOVE NOTED/
AND SOME SEVEN ORIBIGHT MILES FARTHER DOWN STREAM.
AND STILL MORE PUZZLING IS THE PRESENCE OF SOME TALUS, REACHING THE FLOOR OF THE COLUMBIA
VALLEY IN THE GATEWAY, AND 2/3 TO 3/4 THE HEIGHT OF THE CLIFF. IT SHOULD BE SPOKANE IN AGE.
BUT IT MUST BE YOUNGER THAN THE PORTLAND DELTA GRAVEL FILL, ELSE IN THE REMOVAL OF THAT FILL, A
THE TALUS DEBRIS WOUDD GO ALSO.
(JUNIPER CANYON HAS THE ONLY GRAVEL TERRACE IN THE GATEWAY)
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CRITERION OF TALUS HEIGHT ON WALLS?

AGE OF THE GRAVEL AT COLD SPRINGS RESERVOIR DAM STILL IN DOUBT.
TRAVERSE MADE FROM JUNIPER
CANYON TO THE RESERVOIR TO SEE F THIS GRAVEL OCCURRED ON HIGHER SLOPES OF THE FOLD. BUT THESE
SLOPES ARE UNIVERSALLY MANTLED WITH LOESS AND SAND. NOT A LEDGE OF BASALT IN SIGHT FROM THE
COLUMBIA TO THE RESERVOIR.
ON THE SURFACE OF THIS AEOLIAN DEPOSIT, UP TO 1200 AT ANY RATE,
rv.
THERE ARE SCATTERED FRAGMENTS OF GRANITE, SCHIST, DIORITES, QUARTZITE, ETC.
THESE, WHERE
LARGE AND ANGULAR AND IN "NESTS", ARE ASCRIBED TO THE LATE PLEISTOCENE SUBMERGENCE AND ITS FLOAT-
ING ICE.
BUT NONE OF THIS CATEGORY FOUND, ABOVE 1014 AT.T
AT HIGHER AND LOWER LEVELS WERE FOUND SMOOTH, WORN RIVER PEBBLES OF QTZITE AND OTHER FOREIGN
MATERIALS.
THEY OCCUR ALONG TWO OR THREE ROADS WHICH WERE FOLLOWED IN PART, BUT THEY WERE
NOT FOUND ON ADJACENT: AREAS ALONGSIDE THE ROAD. THIS SEEMS TO MEAN THAT GRAVEL HAS BEEN
HAULED OVER THE ROADS, THO THE COUNTRY IS ONLY A WINTER SHEEP GRAZING GROUND AND THE ROADS ARE
MERE PATHS THRU THE SAGE.
STILL, THE GRAVEL MAY HAVE COME FROM THE RIVER AND GONE TO THE
WHEAT COUNTRY 10 MILES OR SO FARTHER SOUTH.
WHERE RIVER PEBBLES LIE AT LOWER LEVELS, THEY OCCUR SCATTERED PRETTY WELL OVER THE AREA,
ESPECIALLY BELOW ABOUT 900 FT A.T. MA BUT SO NUMEROUS IS THE ERRATIC MATRERIAL ALSO BELOW THIS
ALTITUDE THAT THE TWO KINDS OF SCATTERED DEBRIS MAY HAVE COME FROM THE SAME FLÖATING ICE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, SUCH RIVER PEBBLES MAY MEAN THE PRESENCE OF THE GRAVEL FORMATION EXPOSED
AT THE RESERVOIR DAM; BURIED BENEATH THE LOESS AND SAND.
TherE ISNT a SCAR OR GULLY IN THE
4 RT
REGION, BY WHICH TO ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION.
AND ALONG THE SHORES OF THE RESERVOIR, WAVES HAVE CUT CLIFFS 6-8 FT HIGH IN THE LOESS AND
SAND WITHOUT REALING A SINGLE FOREIGN PEBBLE IN THE EOLIAN MATERIAL OR WASHED OUT OF IT.
THE LOESS APPEARS TO BE OLDER THAN THE SCATTERED GRAVEL, HOWEVER IT MAY HAVE COME THERE.
AND
FROM THE WAY THESE WISCONSIN ERRATIC PEBBLES STILL LIE ON THE SURFACE, THERE HAS BEEN VERY
LITTLE LOESS IAL ACCUMULATION SINCE THEN. SI

TOPOGRAPHY OF THIS UPLAND HAS SOME PECULIAR FEATURES. AS SHOWN ON CONNELL QUADRANGLE, THE
MAIN VALLEYS (OLD MAID AND DUNN&GAN COULEES, RYE GRASS FLAT) DRAIN SW BY W, WHILE NEARLY ALL
THE SMALLER ONES DRAIN SW BY S. THE DETERMINATION OFTHIS CURIOUS PATTERN (FOR IT CANT BE
COINCIDENCE) IS NOT STRUCTORE OF BEDROCK FOR THE LOESS IAL MANTLE IS 80 FT IN DEPTH AN THE MAIN
VALLEYS, ACCORDING TO WELL RECORDS, AND ALL HILLS AND VALLEYS ARE FASHIONED IN THE LOESS.
THE GENERAL EXPRESSION OF THE TOPOGRAPHY IS TYPICALLY OF THE PALOUSE HILLS TYPE. BUT
THIS LATTICE-ASKEW PATTERN IS DIFFERENT FROM THE DENDRITIC PATTERN OF WHITMAN CO. AND THERE ISNT
MUCH CONCAVITY OF PROFILES. THE SLOPES SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THIS REGION. IS EARLIER IN THE
CYCLE.
ANOTHER PECULIAR THING SEEN IN THE TWO COULEES, OLD MAID AND DUNNIGAN, AND SHOWN ON THE MAP
IN RYEGRASS FLAT, IS THE NOTEWORTHY DIFFERENCE IN CHARACTER OF #HE TWO SLOPES.
THE SLOPE
FROM THE SOUTH IS VERY GENTLE, MOST PROFILES SHOWING 2° TO 2 1/2°. THE SLOPE FROM THE NORTH

BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN SLOPE OF THE TWO SIDES !! IT MAY BE THAT THIS SHOULD BE LOOKED AT
FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF DIVIDES, INSTEAD OF VALLEYS. TH THEN THE SCHEME WOULD BE- LONG RIDGES,
BROKEN INTO HILLS, CUT BY DRAINAGE LINES, YET MAINTAINING A PREVAILING LONG NORTHEN SLOPE AnD
STEEP SOUTHERN SLOPE. CAN THIS SHAPE BE DUE TO LOESS IALAGORETION ORIGINALLY 3 JF SO, WHAT
DETERMINES THE PERSISTENT ORIENTATION, ABOUT 45° TO THAT OF THE RIDGES ?
SOME OF THESE VALLEYS
ACROSS THE DIVIDES, THO HIGHER OF COURSE ON THE AXIS, REALLY, THEY ARE TWO VALLEYS, DRAINING

THE BEST EVIDENCE AS TO THE LOESSIAL CHARACTER OF THE SUPERBASALT SEDIMENT IS AFFORDED BY A
ROAD CUT ON THE WESTERN BRIKK OF DEVIDS CANYON, A MILE AND A HALF IN A DIRECT LINE SOUTH OF
KAHLOTUS.
HERE THE GLACIAL STREAM WHICH OUT THE CANYON MADE A STEEP SCARP IN THE LOESS AND
THE ROAD GRADING HAS EXPOSED MATERIAL WHICH ORIGINALLY WAS AT THE BASE IN TEE CENTER OF THE HILL.
IT IS LOESS, AND FULL OF SECONDARY LIME IN SEAMS AND ROOTLET CASTS. THESE ROOT CASTS ARE
INDISPUTABLE.
SOME ARE SHELLS D. IPOSITED AROUND SAGE ROOTS, 2-3 INCHES IN DIAMETER, IDENTICAL
WITH THOSE SEEN IN PRESENT SOILS AT COLD SPRINGS RESERVOIR.
FURTHERMORE, THERE ArE AT LEAST
THREE REDDENED ZONES IN THE CUT, DOUBTLESS OLD OXIDIZED SURFACES, LATER BURIED IN THE ACCUMULATING


DEVILS CANYON IS A SMALL BUT WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE SPOKANE FLOODS DID IN THE
COLUMBIA PLATEAU COUNTRY. THE FLOOD WATERS REACHED TO 10000R 1150.
ABOVE THIS LEVEL ARE
THE STEEPENED SLOPES OF THE LOESS, 30°-33°, FACING SCABLAND BELOW THAT LEVEL. SCABLAND A LITTLE
WIDER THAN THE TOP OF THE CANYON, ESPECIALLY AT JUNCTION OF WASHTUNA COULEE AND DEVILS CANYON.
THE FLOOD FOUND A SMALL LEAK SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE PALOUSE HILLS TOPOGRAPHY AT KAHLOTUS AND A
DEEP SNAKE RIVER CANYON INTO WHICH IT PLUNGED. RAPIDS, CASCADES AND FALLS OVER THE EOGES
OF THE BASALT FLOWS.AT ONCE DEVELOPED AND RETREATED NORTHWARD.
THIS SHORTLY CONCENTRATED
THE WATER INTO THE CANYON PROPER.
A FALL AT ONE LEVEL, BELO THE BRINK OF THE CANYON, WAS
DOUBLE AT ONE STAGE. THE ABANDONED HALF, WITH A GOAT ISLAND BETWEEN IT AND THE MAIN CANYON,
IS ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN WASHTUCN^ COULEE AND SNAKE RIVER.
THE HALF OF THE FALL WHICH WON ALL
THE DRAINAGE RETREATED ALMOST TO WASHTUNA COULEE WHEN THE SPOKE DRAINAGE FAILED AND THE CANYON
WENT DRY, NEVER TO CARRY WATER AGAIN. BY
DUE TO THE DEPTH OF THE CANYON, THE MINOR DRAINAGE LINES FROM THE PAẞOUSE HILLS COUNTRY
IMMEDIATELY EAST HAVE DEEPENED IN POST-SPOKANE TIME AND CUT CONSIDERABLY INTO BASALT, THE LEDGES
OF WHICH SHOW PLAINLY ON THE LOWER SLOPES. THEIR PROFILES ARE THOSE OF REJUVENATED VALLEYS, ALSO
IRREGULAR, ERODED SURFACE OF BASALT BENEATH THE LOESS HILLS.

THE
COVER IS A FINE SOIL, NOT THE PRODUCT OF BASALT DIS INTEGRATION. THE TALUS, WHERE CUT BY THE
R. HAS CONSIDERABLE VERY FINE MATERIAL IN IT. TO BOTH THESE THINGS SEEM TO INDICATE DEPOSITION
OF WIND-BLOWN DUST IN UNUSUAL AMOUNT DURING POST-SPOKANE TIME.
PALOUSE CANYON WAS PROBABLY FORMED BY RECESSION OF FALLS AND CASCADES. AS EVIDENCE FOR
THIS IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT SOME OF THE CANYONS ON THE GENERAL SCABLAND, RELATIVELY SHALLOW OF
COURSE, COMPARED WITH THE PALOUSE CANYON, PLUNGE ABRUPTLY INTO THE LOWER PART OF THE CANYON AND
HAVE SHORT GORGES AND ABANDONED FALLS 1000 TO 2000 FEET BACK FROM THE MAIN CANYON.

DERP CANYON IN IT ((OR-WHEN THE WIDE SCABLAND WAS COMPLETELY FLOODED FROM THE NORTH)), AND

•
THEIR RELATIOSS TO THE LOWER CANYON INDICATE THAT IT EXISTED DURING THEIR ACTIVITY, IT FOLLOWS
THAT THE PALOUSE CANYON WAS NOT ERODED UNIFORMLY ALONG ITS ENTIRE LENGTH BUT BEGAN AT SNAKE RIVER
AND LENGTHENED BY HEADWARD REESS ION, THE ORIGINAL BASALT BARRIER SOUTH OF PALOUSE FALLS, STA (O-1)

THIS IS SHOWN
THEY HAVE WELL-GRADED
SLOPES, THO CUT IN BASALT FOR SEVERAL 100 FEET. AFT
FURTHER EVIDENCE FOR THIS CONCLUSION IS THE CHARACTER OF THE MOUTH OF PALOUSE VALLEY AT

THEY LIE ON THE MARGINS OF THE TRACT, OF COURSE, And ARE THE HIGHEST BASALT, BEING IMMEDIATELY
OVERLAIN BY THE LOESS. THE SPOKANE FLOOD WHICH BROKE SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE PRE-SPOKANE DIVNI
PALOUSE HILLS ON THE DIVIDE, PLUNGED OVER A BASALT WALL 350 TO 500 FT HIGH TO REACH SNAKE RIVER.
SUCH A GIGANTIC CASCADE HAD ENORMOUS EROSIVE POSER AND THE FALLS AND CASCADES GENERATED SAPPED
NORTHWARD, CONCENTRATING IN PALOUSE CANYON, UNTIL THE BARRIER WAS ENTIRELY REMOVED AND ALL POST-
SPOKE PALOUSE DRAINAGE HAS GONE THIS WAY.

NORTHWARD AND NORTHEASTWARD FROM LACROSSE, THE MATURE TOPOGRAPHY OF LOW, GENTLE SLOPES IS
INTERRUPTED BY THREE PROMINENT DEEP, WIDE NOTCHES, CUT DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF THE FLAT ON WHICH
THE TOWN IS BUILT, AND THUS ISOLATING TWO BIG HILLS FROM THE REST OF THE PALOUSE HILLS TOPOGRAPHY.
THE SIDES OF THESE NOTCHES ARE STEEP, PERHAPS 30°, THO A PROPER POSITION FOR SIGHTING ON THEM
WAS NOT SECURED.
AT LACROSSE AND WESTWARD TO BENNER, WILLOW CREEK FLAT IS FLOORED WITH
BASALTIC RUBBLE, RANGING IN SIZE FROM PEBBLES TO SMALL BOULDERS.
HERE AND THERE IS A BIT OF
BARE BASALT, CONSTITUTING A LOW KNOLL. SO A CAREFUL WATCH ALL THE WAY TO BENNER DISCLOSED ONLY
TWO PIECES OF ROCK, OTHER THAN THE BASALT AND THE CALICHE-LIKE CALCAREOUS MATERIAL COMMON IN THE
PLATEAU.
THESE WERE SMALL BOULDERS OF GRANITE, CLOSE TOGETHER AND PROBABLY ONE ORIGINALLY.
THE LARGER FRAGMENT IS 2 FT MAXIMUM DIAMETER.
THEY LIE 2 MI. WEST OF LACROSSE IN THE FIELD ON
THE NORTH OF THE ROAD.
AT BENNER IS A SAND AND BRAVEL PIT.
THE MATERIAL IS ALMOST WHOLLY BASALT.
AMONG HUNDRED
OF BOULDERS AND COBBLES REJECTED AS TOO LÖRGE FOR THE CRUSHER, ONLY FOUR FOREIGNERS WERE FOUND;
THREE DIFFERENT GRANITES AND ONE SILICEOUS METAMORPHIC SHOT WITH VEIN $7## / QUARTZ.
THIS DEPOSIT AT BENNER CONSTITUTES A TERRACE, F°CING WEST.
THE DESCENT OVER THE SCARP
IS 50 REET.
-HE GRAVEL AND SAND EXPOSED ARE WELL SORTED AND STRATIFIED, COARSER COBBLES IN
UPPER PART AND FINE SAND IN BOTTOM OF THE PIT. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF CEMENTATION OR STAINING;
THE MABERIAL SEEMS AS FRESH AS ThE GRAVEL IN THE SPOKANE SCABLANDS.

NOW THE COMBINATION OF THE THREE STEEP-SIDED NOTCHES NORTHyNORTHEAST OF LACROSSE AND THE
GRAVEL FILLING AND SCATTERED SCABBY KNOBS OF BASALT LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE GLACIAL DRAINAGE
FROM THE NORTH.
ADD TO THAT THE ERRATIC COBBLES AND BLDRS FOUND, AnD THE CASE IS ESTABLISHED.
GLACIAL WATERS DID GO THRU THE WINONA-LACROSSE ROUTE, WHICH WAS INDICATED AS DOUBTFUL IN MY
BGSA ArTICLE, MAP.
NOw, WAS THIS SPOKANE DRAINAGE?
OR EARLIER?
AN EXAMINATION OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA
WAS MADE: (1) SLOBES OF THE LOESCHILLS FACING THE CHANNEL
(2) THE CHARACTER OF THE GRAVEL
(3) THE CONDITION OF THE TERRACES
(4) THE SCABLAND CHARACTER (ESP. TALUS) "
(5) THE RELATIONS OF THE MOUTH OF THIS DRAINAGE LINE TO THE PALOUSE SCABLAND.
(1) THE SLOPES ArE AppARENTLY STEEP ENOUGH TO BE SPOKANE.
(2) THE GRAVEL IS FRESH ENOUGH
AND UNCONSOLIDATED.
(3) THE TERRACES ARE CONSIDERABLY DISSECTED, AND WHOLLY ABSENT Ay PAMPA;
INDEED, FROM BENNER TO THE PALOUSE SCABLAND. (4) NO SCABLAND PRESENT, OR ONLY SUGGESTIONS OF
IT.
THIs BECAUSE THE STREAM HAD ONLY A LOW GRADIENT.
HENCE, NO TALUS BY WHICH TO JUDGE.
(5) THE TERRACE GRAVEL AT THE JUNCTION OF WILLOW CREEK AND PALOUSE SCABLAND AREA LIES BELOW THE
HIGHEST SCABLAND LEVELS AND BLENOS INTO THE TERRACES DEPOSITED HERE BY WATERS COMING DIRECTLY
FROM THE NORTH.
ALL TOLD, IT IS SPOKAnE IN Age.
LITTLE DAMAGE WAS DONE TO THE BASALT BENEATH, HOWEVER.
STILL, THE QUANTITY OF BASALT RUBBLE AND GRAVEL AND SAND SUGGEST THAT FARTHER NORTH, GREATER EFFECF
ON THE BED ROCK SHOULD BE FOUND.

VERY LITTLE IN THE WAy OF GRANITE BOULDERS ON THE SCABLAND BETWEEN PAMP AND HOOPER. THIS
IS SIMILAR TO THE SITUATION ON THE SCABLAND BETWEEN HOOPER AND SNAKE RIVER. IT MAY BE BECAUSE

THERE ARE ALSO MINOR CHANNELS AMONG THESE PALOUSE HILLS, CROSSING THE GROUPS, BUT
NOT ERODED ENOUGH TO HAVE A SCABLAND FLOOR.
CANYONS IN THE SCABLAND, PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER,
ARE LIMITED TO THE FIRST FEW MILES NORTH OF THE PALOUSE (EXCEPT COW CREEK VALLEY).
THIS IS
BECAUSE ONLY AS THE GLACIAL WATERS CAME OFF THE SCABLAND DOWN INTO THE PRE- POKANE PALOUSE

THE KAHLOTUS AND LANTZ REGIONS HAVE BEEN EXAMIN-
ED SUFFICIENTLY TO JUSTIFY A JUDGMENT AND THE GENESS/ OF THE FEATURES AT LACROSSE IS FAIRLY:
VLAX CLEAR.
THE LANTZ SITUATION IS SIMPLE.
THERE IS ONLY ONE SECTION OF PLEISTOCENE
MATERIAL OF ANY IMPORTANCE "NEAR LANTZ AND THAT IS A 7 OR 8 FOOT CUT IN LOESS ON THE EAST BLUFF
OF THE GRAVEL-FLOORED CHANNEL WHICH LEADS TO BENGE.
THERE ARE NODULES, ROOT CASTS, ROOTLET
CASTS AND SEAMS (ALONG STRATIFICATION PLANES) OF LIME IN THIS LOESS (ALSO A RIB-BONE, MUCH RAMBED

THE UNDERLYING BASALT HERE IS COMPOSED OF LARGE
COLUMBS As, SHOWN. IN THE SCABLAND HALF A MILE FARTHER EAST, AND BLDRS OF DECOMPOSITION WERE AVAIL-

THE BLDR IS ROUNDED, HARDLY SUBANGULAR. 3 ROUNDING PERHAps

WHETHER OR NOT THESE ArE
GLACIAL STRIAE IS A QUESTION.
THEY DONT LOOK LIKE BRUISE MARKS WHICH MIGHT BE PROUCED IF FLOAT-

vET IT ISNT APPARENT WHY The STRIAE OCCUR ONLY NEAR ONE END.
This
ONE GRANITE HAS BEEN CHIPPED BY A HAMMER RECENTLY. PROBABLY PARDEE EXAMINED THIS PLACE,
SAW THE GRANITES, THE STRIATED BASALT, THE BAR FORM AND THE SCABLAND TV/ AND THEREFORE INCLUDED
LANTZ IN HIS CATALOG.
*A BOWLOERY TILL IN A MORAINAL RIDGE, HE PROBABLY CONCLUDED.
NOW, AT LANTZ AND KAHLOTUS, THE STORY IS CLEAR. CHE CHANNEL-LIKE SCEBLANDS, THE SCARPED
LOESSIAL HILLS AND ALL RELATIONS INDICATE THAT THE CORRECT HYPOTHESIS IS THAT OF GLACIAL DRAINAGE,
NOT GLACIAL ICE.

IT ApPEaRS CLEAR NOW THAT THE INTERPRETATION SUGGESTED IN BGSA PAPER FOR DEEP CREEK VALLEY NEAR

BE BLAMED FOR DESTRUCTION OF A MORAINE?

THE REARDON SCABLAND CHANNEL BETWEEN EDWALL AND GRAVELLE IS A VERY STRIKING VALLEY. @
LARGELY CONFINED WITHIN LIMITS OF A PRE-SPOKANE VALLEY, 200-250 FT DEEP.
O HO THERE IS NOT
MUCH IN THE WAY OF STEEPENED SLOPES, THE FLOOR BEARS MUCH SCABROCK AND THE VALLEY IS WIDE AND O
FAIRLY STRAIGHT, CLEANED OUT OF PROJECTING SPURS CLOSE TO THE OLD FLOODPLAIN. 010 YENT BA CAme
*3 NORTH OF DAVENPORT, THE LIMITS REACHED BY THE SPOKANE ICE SHEET ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO
DETERMINE. BATHERE IS A BASALT PLAIN TO THE NORTH OF THE PALOUSE HILLS AND THE HIGHER GRANITE
HILLS. THE PLAIN IS DEEPLY DISSECTED BY CANYONS IN BASALT, DRAINING TO SPOKANE RIVER. ONLY
THE ABSENCE OF PALOUSE HILLS AND LOESS, AND WHE PRESENCE OF GRANITE ERRATICS, AND THE FORMER
FUNCTIONING OF THE DRAINAGE CHANNELS AT LORENE, MONDO I AND DAVENPORT INDICATE THAT AN ICE TOO
SHEET COVERED THIS PLAIN.


DAVENPORT TO HARRINGTON TO ODESSA TO WILBUR 0 AUGUST 9 1923
A SMALL SPILLWAY LEADS DIRECTLY SOUTH FROM DAVENPORT TOWARD BLUESTEM.
NO SCABROCK OR
GRAVEL SEEN FOR THE TWO MILES EXAMINED, BUT ApPARENTLY SCABROCK ABOUT 1 1/2 MILES FARTHER
SOUTH.
JOINS OR IS CONNEETED WITH THE BROAD SCABLAND SW OF DAVENPORT AND SOUTH OF ROCKLYN.
LITTLE SCABROCK ALONG NORTH CENTRAL HIGHWAY SOUTH OUT OF DAVENPORT, THO BASALT IS JUST
BENEATH THE SURFACE.
SEMI-SCAB, THIS MIGHT BE CALLED.
TWO MILES NORTH OF BLUESTEM, THE
WIDE AREA SPLITS INTO AT LEAST FOUR CHANNELS, ALL WITH SCABROCK FLOORS.
THREE LEAD TO HARRING-
TON VIA THE CANYONED CHANNEL, AND ONE TOWARD BLUESTEM AND DOUBTLESSTO THE REARDON ROUTE WHERE
CROSSED BY THE GRR• THE THREE TOWARD HARRINGTON ALL CONVERGE INTO ONE ABOUT THREE MIEES
AVORA OMA
NORTH OF THE TOWN.
A SPLENDID SECTION IN A PALOUSE HILL 1 1/2 MILES NORTH OF HARRINGTON.
HE GLACIAL RIVER
CUT OFF THE NOSE OF THE HILL NOD THE G.N. RECENTLY IMPROVED THE CUT.
THE SECTION EXPOSES LOESS
ONLY AND IT IS 48 FEET FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
ABOUT 25 FEET BELOW THE R GRADE IS THE ROADWAY.
THE SECTION HERE IS OBSCURED BUT ONLY LOESS SHOWING IN THE FEW SCARS.
THIS MAY, HOWEVER, BE
SLUMP MATERIAL.
TOP OF BASALT, SO FAR &S SHOWN IN THE CHANNEL IS LOWER THAN ROADWAY.
THE LOESS IS STRATIFIED CHRUOUT.
WHEN SEEN, A REGENT RAIN HAD WET THEF-ACE AND A NUMBER
OF DIFFERENT REDDENED ZONES WERE EASILY VISIBLE.
THESE ARE TAKEN TO BE OLD SURRACES, ST
OXIDIZED DURING THE ACCUMULATION OF THE LOESS.
ROOTLET MARKS, FINE ENOUGH AND ABUNDANT ENOUGH
TO HAVE BEEN GRASS ROOTS, ARE COMMON.
INDEED, THE MATERIAL IS FULL OF THEM.
NOT A SQUARE
FOOT THAT DOESNT SHOW FROM SEVERAL TO PERHAPS A HUNDRED.
MARKINGS ARE RECORDED IN CACOB
MUCH LIME DEPOSITED ALSO IN STRATIFICATION PLANES.
SOME HORIZONS PARTIALLY INDURATED
BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THE LIME.
AT ODESSA THERE ARE INTERESTING RELATIONS BETWEEN SCABLAND, CANYONS, PALOUSE TOPOGRAPHY
AND GRAVEL DEPOSITS.
A HUGE GRAVEL BAR, THREE MILES OR SO IN LENGTH, DEPENDS FROM THE ANGLE
BETWEEN LAKE AND CRAB CREEKS.
IT MUST BE NEARLY 100 FT ABOVE THE VALLEY FLOORS. THRU IT O
PROJECT SEVERAL BIG BASALT KNOBS AND BUTTES, THE RELICS OF THE PRE-SPOKE SHOULDER AT THE JOT.
SEVARY
OF LAKE AND GRAB CREEK VALLEYS.
AT THE SAME LEVEL IS AN EXTENSIVE VALLEY FILL IN THE LOWER F/EW MILES OF DUCK CREEK VALLEY.
ITS DISSECTION IS BUT SLIGHT.
IT LOOKS LIKE THE$ SURFACE OF THE ADRIAN GRAVEL TERRACE WHICH A
LAST SUMMER WAS INTERPRETED As WISCONSIN IN AGE.
IT SEEMS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THESE ALL BELONG
TO ONE FILL, OF SPOKANAGE, ADJUSTED TO THOLEVEL OF THE QUINCY BASIN GRAVEL FILL. PERHAPS
TRIBUTARY CONTRIBUTIONS, PERHAPS SIMPLY SPARED BY POST-SPOKANE STREAM EROSION. TOR SHY TA.
BOTH LAkE CREEK AND GRAB CREEK VALLEYS HERE APPEAR TO BE PRE-SPOKANE IN AGE. NEITHER
HAS SCABLAND BACK FROM THE BRINK OF THE CANYON WALLS.
INSTEAD, PADOUSE HILLS COME TO THE
EDGE. 30 HAD THERE BEEN NO SUCH VALLEYS, 200 FT DEEP IN THE BASALT, TBE FLOODS WOULD NAVE
SPREAD AS THEY DID IN THE CHENEY-SPRAGUE-LAMONT REGION, AND WOULD HAVE UNDERCUT AND REMOVED
THE PALOUSE HILLS OVER A WIDE AREA.
AS IT WAS, IT SEEMS CLEAR AT FROM A SMALL SPILLWAY
3 1/2 MILES NORTH OF ODESSA THAT GLACIAL WATERS OVERRAN THE BRIMS OF THE CANYONS OF DUCK CREEK
AND FOUND NEW ROUTES ACROSS PALOUSE HILL TOPOGRAPHY; NOT SUFFICIENTLY HOWEVER TO MAKE WIDE SCAB
TRACTS. SINCE THESE CANYONS ARE 200 FT DEEP OR MORE, THE GLACIAL RIVERS WERE THAT DEEP TO
CONTAIN THEM, OR ELSE THE CANYONS WERE PARTIALLY FILLED WITH GRAVEL AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF
FOAMTART
THE FLOOD.

THAT THE CANYONS HAD BEEN CUT TO PRESENT DEPTHS IS PRE-SPOKANE TIME SEEMS INDICATED BY
SOME MINOR TRIBUTARY VALLEYS WHICH NEVER WERE INVADED/ BY GLACIAL STREAMS.

ABOUT TELFORD BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AND EXTENDING NORTH TO THESE HIQLS IS A SCABLAND PLAIN
WITHOUT CANYONS AND WITHOUT MUCH RELIEF, THO IT IS ROUGH. / SUCH A PLAIN COULD HARDLY HAVE
BEEN FORMED BY GLACIAL ICE, YET IT ISNT DISTINCTIVELY THE WORK OF GLACIAL WARS. WERE IT NOT
FOR ITS SETTING, WITH PALOUSE HILLS UNGLACIATED TO THE NORTH, IT MIGHT DOUBTFULLY BE RESERRED

THE GRADIENT IS CONSIDERABLE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE SCABLAND BUT IS UNKNOWN. THE DIFFERENCE
IN ALTITUDE BETWEEN ROCKLYN OR TELFORD & AND ODESSA WILL GIVE GRADEENT FOR THE SCABLAND TRACT
AND THE DUCK CREEK DRAINAGE LINE.
RAM PROBABLY THE GLACIAL WATERS DIDNT HAVE ALL THAT AT THE
BEGINNING WHEN THEY SPREAD SO WIDELY, FOR THEN THE CANYONS (DUCK CR., CON-NA-WAI CR., LAKE CR.)
WERE NOT AS DEEP AS NOW.
,НОДО ЭТРАМОАВГ ОТ ОЛАМИТОВ МЭНТ ОИД РТОЯМИ
THE AMOUNT OF DEEPENING AT ODESSA BY SPOKANE WATERS IS DETERMINABLE APPROXIMATELY. THE
PALOUSE VALLEYS IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF THE TOWN, UNTOUCHED BY GLACIAL STREAMS, HAVE THEIR FLOORS
200 FEET OR MORE ABOVE CRAB CREEK VALLEY BOTTOM.
370 AND THEY ARE MATURE WITH CONCAVE SLOPES.
THERE COULD HABE BEEN NO CANYON INVORAB CREEK VALLEY WHEN THEY WERE DEVELOPED. SINCE THESE
PALOUSE HILL VALLEYS WERE DEVELOPT, THE MAIN HAS BEEN DEEPENED 200 FT BY THE SPOKANE DISCHARGE.
THIS RELATION APPARENTLY DISPOSES OF THE CONCEPTION OF A SECOND COLE, REJUVENATED VALLEY
IN CRAB CREEK BEFORE THE SPOKANE GLACIATION. TAHR OTHERWISE, CON-NA-WAI CREEK, DUCK CREEK AND LAKE
CREEK WALLEYS WOULD ALSO HAVE HAD CANYONS IN PRE-SPOKANE TIME. AND ALL FIELD EVIDENCE INDICATES
THARI THESE DIDNT EXIST.
HAD THEY BEEN RESENT, NO WIDE SPREADING ON THE BiG SCABLAND TRACT
WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.

IN OTHER DORDS, IF THESPOKANE IDE SHEET COULD BE RESTORED, ITS DRABNAGE WOULD NOT NOW SPREAD
ALL OVER THE TRACT, NOR WOULD IT HAVE MADE SOME OF THE MINOR CHANNELS ACROSS PALOUSE HILLS, CHAN-
BELS WHICH NEVER REACHED BASALT AND HENCE HAVE NO SCABROCK FLOOR.
THE CANYON-CUTTING OCCURRED
WHILE THE GLACIAL WATERS WERE BEING SUPPLIED, AND BY ITS OCCURRENOE, DREW OFF THE WATERS FROM
THESE MINOR CHANNELS SO THAT THEIR GROWTH IN DEPTH AND WIDTH WAS STOPT EARLY IN THE EPOCH.


THE BIG GRAVEL FILL IN LOWER DUCK CREEK IS ABOUT 200 FT ABOVE CRAB CREEK VALLEY.
IT LIES IN

SEVERAL PLACES IN CRAB CREEK VALLEY HERE HAVE PROMINENT BUTTES AND MESAS, ISOLATED OR
PARTILLY ISOLATED ON THE FLOOR OF THE CANYON. THEY ARE REMNANTS OF THE PRE SPOKANE VALLEY
FLOOR AND THEIR HEIGHT (100 FT IN PLACES) IS A MINIMAL MEASURE OF THE DEPTH OF CANYON-CUTTING
BY THE SPOKANE WATERS • THEY WOULD NOT EXIST IF THIS WERE A NORMAL CANYON, CUT BY A SMALL
STREAM THRU A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. NOTHING OF THIS SORT IS FOUND IN. THE SECOND CYCLE REJUVEN-
ATED CANYONS DRAINING INTO SPOKANE AND COLUMBIA RIVERS FROM THE PLATEAU, OR IN THE REJUVENATED
CANYONS OF PALOUSE RIVER EAST OF THE SCABLANDS.

THE LAKES OF THESE CANYONS, LIKE CRAB, CON-NA-WAI, DUCK, WILSON, ETC., PROVE THAT STREAM
EROSION HAS DONE VERY LITTLE SINCE THE SPOKANE EQOODS SUBSIDED. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE
BIG GRAVEL DEPOSITS, ALREADY NOTED, AND OTHERS BETWEEN KRUPP AND STRATFORD, AS TERRACE REMNANTS
LEFT BY POST-SPOKANE STREAM DISSECTION OF A ONCE CONTINUOUS FILL MUST BE DISCARDED.
HOWEVER TERRACE-LIKE IN FORM, THESE ARE EITHER BARS AND DELTAS BUILT BY TRIBS IN THE MAIN OR
THEY ARE REMNANTS OF A CONTINUOUS FILL, MADE AND DISSECTED DURING THE SPOKANE EPOCH.
IF THE LATTER, A REASON FOR SUCH FILL AFTER CANYON-CUTTING, AND THEN EROSION OF THE FILL, MUST
BE FOUND.
IT MIGHT BE SUGGESTED THAT A MINOR RETREAT OF THEFRONT OF THE SPOKE ICE SHEET MIGHT ALLOW
DEPOSITION OF GRAVEL TO FILL THESE CANYONS COMPLEY ACROSS AND 200 FT DEEP. THEN A RE-ADVANCE
MIGHT SUPPLY WATER TO ERODE.
BUT THE FATAL OBJECTION TO THIS EXPLANATION IS THE FACT THAR IF
A MINOR REDUCTION IN WATER SUPPLY ALLOWED GRAVEL FILLS TO ACCUMULATE, THEN WHEN THE FINAL FAILURE
CAME, THE SAME EVENT WOULD OCCUR.
THE CONCEPTION OF THESE AB BARS IS MORE SATISFACTORY. THE ADRIAN TERRACE MUST THEREFORE
BE GROUPED WITH THESE OTHER BARS.
IT IS FAR LARGER, HOWEVER BUT ITS SURFACE AND THAT OF THE
STRATFORD TERRACE AT BIG 4 ORCHARDS, 2 MILES WEST OF STRATFORD STA., FALL INTO THE SAME PLANE.

THE ONLY WISCONS IN MODIFICATION
IS THEEXCAVATION OF A TRENCH IN IT ABOUT 100 FT DEEP, JOINING THE CRAB CREEK VALLEY AT GRADE
NEAR ADRIAN.
TO MAKE THE ADRIAN GRAVEL SPOKANE iN AGE IS TO SIMPLIFY AND MAKE MORE HARMONIOUS THE
INTERPRETATION OF THE RELATION OF COULEES AND THE OWINCY VALLEY FILL. ALL THE GREAT GRAVEL
DEPOSITS ARE SPOKANE, TI NEAR ADRIAN, THEY ALL HAVE ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL, INOLUDING THE STRATFORD
TERRACE (BIG 4 ORCHARDS), THE ADRUAN TERRACE AND THE BIG ISOLATED GRAVEL MESA SOUTH OF SOAP LAKE

GREAT GRAVEL COVERED AREAS ABOUT GLOYD ALSO FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY.
THE ONLY CHANGES WROUGME BY WISCONS IN DRAINAGE ARE THE THREE BIG VALLEYS SHOWN ON THE WINCHESTER

WHICH ERODED THE CANYONS OF CRAB, CON-NA-WAI, WILSON, L^KE AND DUCK C FEEKS AND SPRING, DRY AND

BE ENTERTAINED WITHOUT GOOD CONFIRMATORY EVIDENCE. 03 A THE OTHER-
THAT THE CANYONS WERE
ERODED BEFORE THE GRAVELS HAD ACCUMULATED IN QUANTITY IN THE MOSES LAKE-QUINCY BASIN, AND THAT
THEIR ACCUMULATION DEMANDED A HIGHER GRADIENT ACROSS THE DEPRESSED TRACT.
THIS EVENTUALLY
BACKED UP THE GRAVELS IN THE COULEES, WHICH AT THAT TIME WERE CONTRIBUTING WATER.
GRAND COULEE
HAD CUT DOWN TO SUCH AN EXTENT BY THIS TIME THAT SPRING COULEE RECEIVED NO OVERFLOW FROM HARTLINE

A GRAVEL DEPOSIT IN OLD MAID COULEE, 4 1/2; MILES SOUTH OF CONNELL ON THE HIGHWAY, HAS BEEN
OPENED FOR ROAD MATERIAL. 15 FEET OF GRAVEL, WITH SOME SAND, UNDERLIE 3 FEET OF HIGHLY
CALCAREOUS SILT, SOME OF IT A PURE WHITE CHALKY LINE THIS IS OVERLAIN BY 10 FT OF LOESS.
AND THIS LOESS IS LOESS, NOT A RESIDUAL SOIL FROM BASALT. THE GRAVEL IS ONLY SLIGHTLY INDUR-
ATED OR STAINED BUT THE BASALT PEBBLES AND COBBLES ARE EASILY FRACTURED FROM WEAKENING BY
DECAY.

ARE PEBBLES AND SOME COBBLES OF A YELLOW GRANULAR QUARTZITE. NOTHING BUT BASALT AND OTZITE
FOUND, SAVE ONEPEBBLE OF DENSE GREY LIMESTONE, UNLIKE THE WHITE, CHALKY LIMESTONE FOUND IN THE


LOESS OF THE PLATEAU.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE TOPOGRAPHY THAT SPOKANE WATERS EVER
FLOWED DOWN OLD NAID COULEE.
AND THO GRANITE IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON ERRATIC MATERIAL
OF THE SPOKANE GRAVEL DEPOSITS, NO GRANITE WAS FOUND IN THIS PIT. g
IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT THIS DEPOSIT WAS MADE ON THE BASALT PLATEAU BY STREAMS WHICH FLOWED
ACROSS IT BEFORE THE LOESS WAS DEPOSITED. THIS INTERPRETATION DEMANDS THE ASSUMPTION THAT
THE PRESENT POSITION IN, AND DIP OF FORESET BEDDING WITH, OLD MAID COULEE IS A COINCIDENCE.
YET HOW CAN IT BE OTHERWISE FOR THE PRESENT DRAINAGE LINE ENCOUNTERS NO QUARTZITE.
THERE ARE TERRACES IN OLD MAID COULEE, ABOUT AS HIGH ON THE VALLEY SLOPES AS THE DEPOSIT
IN QUESTION. A IF THEY ARE COMPOSED OF GRAVEL OF THE CHARACTER OF THAT IN THE DEPOSIT, THEN THIS
GRAVEL WOULD LOGICALLY BE A DEPOSIT IN AND BY THE PRESENT DRAINAGE.
AND SOME SOURCE FOR THE

THE TWO-CYCLE PROBLEM
BARABOO
AUG. 31
HITHERTO THE CONCEPTION OF TWO CYCLES OF VALLEY CUTTING IN WHITMAN COUNTY HAS BEEN ARRIVED
AT BY COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT VALLEYS IN THE PALOUSE RIVER SYSTEM.
REBEL FLAT, SPRING FLAT,
UNION FLAT, ETC. WERE CONSIDERED OLD VALLEYS OF THE FIRST OVOLE (ALL THE MINOR DRAINAGE LINES
OF THE PALOUSE HILLS BELONG TO THE SAME CYCLE WHILE THE CANYONS AT COLFAX AND ELSEWHERE WERE


CONSIDERED TO BELONG TO THE NEW CYCLE.
ONLY AT COLFAX AND ABOVE, HAD THE YOUNG VALLEYS BEEN
SEEN INCISED IN THE FLOOR OF THE OLD ONES.
00 38 0
LATER, DOUBT AROSE AS TO THE VALIDITY OF THE CONCEPTION.
AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION
WAS CONSIDERED; - THAT THE MATURE ASPECT WAS DUE TO EROSION IN THE LOESSIAL MATERIAL ABOVE THE
BASALT, AND THE YOUTHFUL CANYONS WERE DUE WHOLLY TO THE GREATER RESISTANCE OF THE BASALT
TO SLOPE WASH.
THE CRITERION OF GRADIENT WAS NOT ApPLieD.
IF REJUVENATION REALLY HAS OCCURRED, ROADS
AND RAILROADS WHICH FOLLOW THE WHITMAN CO VALLEYS SHOULD SHOW A NOTEWORTHY DECREASE IN GRADIENT
AS THEY EMERGE FROM THE CANYONED PORTION TO THE BROAD FLAT PORTION FARTHER UPSTREAM.
THE VALLEY OF REBEL ELAT CREEK WAS FOODOWED FROM WI NONA, WHERE IT JOINS THE PALOUSE VALLEY, T
TO THE HEAD.
AT WINONA THE PALOUSE R/Ve VALLEY HAS SOME BASALT CLIFFS ANTEDATING THE NO
SPOKANE FLOODS AND REBEL CREEK VALLEY JOINS IT AT ACCORDANT GRADE, WITH A NARROW, STEEP-WALLED
VALLEY IN WHICH BASALT LEDGES SHOW, THO IT IS NOT STRICTLY A CANYON. THE MATURE TOPOGRAPHY
CHARAOTERISES ALL THE UPLANDS ABOUT THIS JUNCTION, EXCEPT WHERE THE LATER SCABLANDS OOCUR.
IN
SUCH A SITUATION, IT IS EASY TO SEE TWO CYCLES. WH
BUT THE TRAVERSE UP REBEL FLAT CREEK SHOWED VIRTUALLY NO CHANGE IN GRADIENT, NO NARROWING
OF THE YOUNGER-LOOKING, LOWER PART AND NO RAVINE HEAD INCISED IN THE FLAT. THERE APPEARS TO
BE A CONTINUOUS NORMAL GRADIENT ALL THE WAy FROM WINONA TO THE HEAD.
THE NARROWNESS OF THE
LOWER VALLEY AND THE STEEPNESS OF ITS WALLS APPEAR TO BE DUE WHOLLY TO THE GREATER RESISTANCE
OF THE BASALT TO SLOPE WASH AND LATERAL PLANATION
7 THIS CONCLUSION HARMONIZES WITH THE CONDITIONS IN ALKALI CREEK VALLEY, ABOVE RIPARIA,
WHERE THERE IS A NORMAL STREAM GRADIENT ALL THE WAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF SNAKE RIVER VALLEY TO
THE SUMMIT OF THE PLATEAU. SURELY, IF TWO CYCLES ARE TO BE FOUND IN ANY VALLEYS, THEY SHOULD
BE FOUND RECORBED IN THE GRADIENT OF SUCH A STREAM, FOR IT HAS MUCH THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR O
CUTTING A SECOND CYCLE CANYON.
IT IS THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT THE APPARENT TWO CYCLE VALLEYS DEPEND ON THE HIGHLY
CONTRASTED CHARACTER OF THE TWO FORM^TIONS, THE LOESS AND THE BASALT.
THERE HAS BEEN NO
UPLIFT TO CAUSE THIS DIFFERENCE.
AN ITEM WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT DOES NOT SEEM TO AGREE WITH THE ABOVE CONCLUSION IS THE FACT
THE# THE PA LOUSE HILLS EAST OF THE SCABLANDS HAVE BASES OF BASALT, I.E. THE MATURE VALLEYS ARE
ERODED SOWHAT IN BASALT.
BUT ISNT THIS A MATTER OF THE SURFICIAL DISINTEGRATION OF THE BASALT
BELOW THE LOESS?
IF IT IS, THIS ITEM DOES NOT MILLTATE AGAINST THE CONCEPTION ABOVE ADVANCED.
YS ANOTHER ITEM IN THIS PROBLEM FLOWS FROM THE STRUCTUR@L CONTROL OF THE DRAINAGE PATTERN IN
THE SOUTHERN PART OF WHITMAN CO.
IT WILL BE DISCUSSED UNDER THAT HEADING.

IT BECAME A CONVICTION AFTER SNAKE RIVER
VALLEY AG LEWISTON AND CLARKSTON HAD BEEN SEEN.
SNAKE RIVER AT LEWISTON FLOWS IN A GREAT SYNCLINE, WITH MUCH STEEPER BRTHERN LIMB. THE
FAMED LEWISTON GRADE, BY WHICH THE HIWAY DESCENDS FROM THE WHITMAN CO PLATEAU TO THE RIVER, IS
CONSTRUCTED ON THIS SOMEWHAT ERODED NORTHERN SLOPE.
THE BASALT EXOOSED IN CUTS IS TILTED
SOUTHWARD AND IN MANY PLACES IS BRECCIATED AND SLICKENED AND ALL TRACES OF COLUMNAR STOCOURE
DESTROYED.
WEST OF THIS GRADE A MILE OR SO ARE GOOD HOGBACKS OF TILTED BASALT FLOWS. THE
STRIKE OF THIS NORTHERN LIMB IS ABOUT N 75°E, AND THE DIP ON THE PROMINENT HOGBACKS IS 21° SWARD.
ALTITUDE AT TOP OF THE GRADE IS 2750, AT THE BOTTOM IT IS 750.
IN THIS DESCENT OF 2000 FT THE
HIGHWAY WINDS AMAZINGLY.
TEN MILES OF ROADWAY ARE NECESSARY TO GO FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE GRADE
TO THE FOOT, A HORIZONTAL DISTANCE ON THE MAP OF TWO MILES.
SNAKE RIVER AND CLEARWATER RIVER HAVE CUT 450 FEET INTO THE FLOOR OF THIS SYNCLINE. THE
SNAKE ENTERS THE SYNCLINE FROM THE SOUTH, THE CLEARWATER NEAR LEWISTON FLOWS ESSENTIALLY ALONG
THE AXIS.
BELOW THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO STREAMS, THE SNAKE FLOWS ALONG THE AXIS FOR SOME MILES,
PROBABLY NOT 100 FT OF BASALT HAS BEEN REMOVESFROM THE HILLTOPS ON THE PLATEAU TO THE NORTH
THE STRUCTURAL DESCENT HERE IS THEREFORE ABOUT 1750 FT.
THE SOUTHERN LIMB OF THE SYNCLINE HAS A MUCH MORE GENTLE SLOPE.
INSTEAD OF TWO MILES HORIZ-
ONTAL IN DIP DIRECTION FROM EDGE TO AXIS, THERE ARE AT LEAST 15 MILES, PERHAPS 20 MILES OR MORE.
ON THIS LONG SLOPE ARE SEVERAL STRUCTURAL TERRACES, SPARATED BY STRUCTURAL SLOPES. ONE OF THESE
TERRACES BARS ORCHARD TRACTS WHICH COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND IRRIGATED HAD NOT THE
STRUCTURAL FLAT BEEN PRESENT.
THAT THIS VALLEY AT THE JCT OF SNAKE AND CLEARWATER RIVERS IS NOT EROSIONAL IS EIDENT.
THE VALLEY OF SNAKE RIVER. IN ENTERING THE SY@CLINE IS A NARROW, STEEP-WALLED CANYON, DEEPER IN
THE UPDIP DIRECTION AND WHOLLY UNLIKE THE GREAT CAPACIOUS VALLEY AT LEWISTON-CLARKSTON.
THE SURFACE OF THE COLUMBIA BASALT AT THE CROSSING OF THE WASH-IDAHO LINE AND SNAKE RIVER
IS THEREFORE THROWN INTO A MAJOR FOLD, COMPARABLE IN MAGNITUDE TO ANY OTHER FOLDS OF THE PLATEAU,
OR ANY OF THE CASCADE MT SPURS SAVE BADGER MT. WEST OF THE COLUMBIA.
BUT IT IS A DOWNFOLD,
NOT AN UPFOLD.
IT IS ASYMMETRICAL, AS ARE PRACTICALLY ALL THE GREAT FOLDS OF THE PLATEAU.
THERE ARE NO @COMPANYING GREAT UPFOLDS, THO SEVERAL MINOR ONES EXIST.
WITH THIS EVIDENCE OF FOLDING IN THE PLATEAU, CONTROLLING THE GREAT DRAINAGE LINE OF THE
PLATEAU, IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO APPLY THE SAME HYPOTHESIS TO THE CURVILINEAR DRAINAGE OF THE
MINOR STREAMS.
IN THE BASALT TO SHOW STRUCTURE.
THIS MUST ALL BE WORKED OUT IN TERMS OF TOPOGRAPHY FOR THERE ARE NO SECTIONS
BUT SINCE TOPOGRAPHY IS SO STRIKINGLY CONTROLLED BY


BY STRUCTURE, DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF THE LARGEST STREAMCCROSSING THE COLUMBIA PLATEAU, IT IS A
SAFE GUIDE.
IN THE FIELD, AND ON THE TOPOGRAPHIC MAP, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE DIVIDES SEPARATING
THESE CLOSELY SPACED CURVILINEAR STREAMS ARE ANTICLINAL, AND ARE HIGHER THAN THE UNWARPED
SURFACE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF WHITMAND CO AND ABOUT MOSCOW.
THE STREAMS THEREFORE FLOW
IN SHALLOW SYNCLINES AND ARE MUCH LONGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR DRAINAGE AREA THAN THEY WOULD
BE IN A NORMAL DENDRITIC PATTERN• Aniv38
THE "FLATS" OF UNION CREEK, REBEL CREEK, ETC., ARE THEREFORE NOT EROSIONAL VALLEYS SO MUCH
As THEY ARE STRUCTURAL.
THE MADURE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PALOUSE HILLS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WITH
RELATIVE RAPIDLY IN THE LOESS AND THE DECAYED UPPER PART OF THE BASALT, BEFORE THE TRENCHING
OF THE PLATEAU BASALT BY THE MAJOR STREAMS HAS REACHED BACK INTO THE REGION.
