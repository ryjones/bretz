NOT A VALLEY FILL.

DEVILS CANYON TO PERRY ALONG SNAKE RIVER
JULY 20-22 1924
A SMALL SPILLWAY FROM WASHTUNA COULEE TO
•EVEILS CANYON IS IN SECTION 15, ABOUT 2 MILES
SOUGH OF KAHLOTUS.
BASALT OUTCROPS AT THE HIGHEST PLACE IN THE CHANNEL FLOOR, BUT PROBABLY
DOES NOT OCCUR HIGHER IN CHANNEL WALLS.
ALTITUDE OF HIGH POINT IN FLOOR IS NEARLY 1300. ORIG-
INAL ALTITUDE OF THE LOW PLACE IN HILL PROFILE, ACROSS WHICH THE GLACIAL WATERS FLOWED, COULD
HARDLY HAVE BEEN LOWER THAN 1300 AND MAN HAVE BEEN 1350
USE THIS ITEM AS ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE
OF DEPTH OF GLACIAL STREAM IN WASHTU@@A COULEE.
FEATURES AT MOUTH OF DEVILS CANYON ARE SINGULARLY INTERESTING.
THE CANYON MOUTHS ABOUT
140 FT ABOVE SNAKE RIVER JULY LEVEL.
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLARING MOUTH (WHICH VERY PROBABLY
IS A RELIC OF A PRE-SPOKANE SHORT TRIBUTARY VALLEY) IS A BASALT BUTTE OF NO REMARKABEE PROPORTIONS
BUT FLANKED BY POST SPOKANE TALUS AND CLEARLY A SCABLAND KNOB, ERODED OUT OF THE PRE SPOKANE
ELOOR.
FROM THE BROAD TOP OF THE KNOB AND THE LOWNESS OF THE EMINENCE, IT SEEMS THAT BUT
20930
LITTLE ERDS ION WAS DONE HERE.
1708.300
PROBECCING IN PART BEYOND THE LINE OF THE SNAKE VALLEY WALL IS A GRAVEL DEPOSIT AT THE
MOUTH OF DEVILS CANYON.
IN GENERAL, IT IS ABOOT 160 FEET ABOVE THE RIVER, OR 120 FEET ABOVE
THE RAILROAD, BUT IT BEARS A REMARKABLE RIDGE WHICH RISES SIXTY FEET HIGHER FOR ITS MAXIMUM.
THIS RIDGE IS A SHAPED LIKE A HORSESHOE WITH THE CONCAVITY UPSTREAM AND THE TWO ENDS ABUTTING
AGAINST THE WALLS OF THE FLARING MOUTH OF THE CANYON.
IN ADDITION, THIS GRAVEL RIDGE IS
HIGHEST AT THE APEX OF THE CURVE AND SYMMETRICALLY LOWER ON BOTH LIMBS, THE LOWEST PLACES BEING
NEXT TO THE ROCKY WALLS.
THUS THE HORSESHOE ENCLOSES A BASIN, OR DID WHEN THE GLAC(AL RIVER CEASD TO FLOW. POST-
SPOKANE DRAINAGE TRU DEVILS CANYON HAS CUT A RAVINE THRU THE RIDGE WHERE IT dOINS THE EASTERN
VALLEY WALL.
THE SLOPES OF THE GRAVEL RIDGE ARE GENTLER TOWARD THE CONCAVITY I.E. UPSTREAM, THAN THEY ARE
TOWARD SNAKE RIVER VALLEY.
THIS CURIOUS GRAVEL RIDGE IS A BAR. IT IS IDENTICAL WITH THE BARS FORMED ACROSS TORRENTIAL
STREAMS WHERE THERE IS A SLACKENING OF VELOCITY FROM INCREASED WITH OF CHANNEL. IT IS DUPLI-
CATED INEVERY ROADSIDE GUTTER AFTER A HEAVY RAIN. IT IS THE SAME THING AS AT SOAP LAKE, EXCEPT
THAT THE DIMENSIONS ARE MUCH SMALLER AND THE SLOPES MUCH STEEPER.
BOTH SOAP LAKE AND THIS
DEVILS CANYON AFFAIR AAVE BRODED ROCKY EMINENCES IN. THE ENCLOSED BASIN, AS LOW AS, OR LOWER #HAN
THE RIM OF ThE GRAVEK BAR.
NIOMa 90 87980950 0ш
ADM 129 Н
THIS HORSESHOE-SHAPED BAR IS EVIDENCE INCONTROVERTIBLE THAT A GREAT TORRENT MADE DEVILS
CANYON, THAT THAT TORRENT ABRUPTLY CEASED TO FLOW, AND THAT SNAKE RIVER SURFACE AT THAT TIME WAS
AT LEAST 200 FEET HIGHER THAN AT PRESENT (JULY LEVEL)SARS THE FACT THAT THE GRAVEL DEPOSIT ON
WHICH THIS BAR RESTS CONTINUES DOWN TO THE RIVER LEVEL SHOWS THAT THE RIVER VALLEY THEN WAS
ERODED TO PRESENT DEPTH AND AT THAT TIME WAS UNFILLED
THE CORROLARY IS THAT THE RIVER WAS
AT LEAST 220 FEET DEEP.
THE MATERIALS OF ThE GRAVEL DEPOSIT ARE BUT POORLY SHOWN. IN R CUTS AND IN THE POST-
SPOKANE RAVINE, THE GRAVEL IS SHOWN TO BE POORLY SORTED AND LITTLE WORN.
IT IS PRACTICALLY ALL
BASALT.
THE LARGE AMOUNT OF SILTY MATERIAL, FILLING ALL INTERSTICES, SUGGESTS ITS DERIVATION
FROMDESTRUCTION OF LOESS IAL HILLS ON THE SCABLANDS FARTHER NORTH.


A CLOSER SCRUTINY OF THE DEVILS CANYON BAR SHOWS PORTIONS OF A LARGER OLDER FEATURE, ON
WHICH THE ONE DESCRIBED HAS BEEN BUILT.
THE TOPOGRAPHER WHO SKETCHED THIS WAS QUITE AT
SEA AS TO ITS ORIGIN.
HE SHOWS IT AS A MINOR RIDGE PROJECTING FROM THE WEST WALL, DUE TO
POST-CANYON DISSECTION BY LOCAL DRAINAGE.

DEVILS CANYON, AX HAS AN ELONGATION ACONG VALEY SIDES BUT DAMS A TRIBUTARY OR A LOCAL BROADENING.
SUBSEQUENT DRAINAGE HAS GASHED IT THRU.
ANOTHER IS ESSENTIALLY A DELTA TERRACE, AT DAVIN STATION, ON NORTH SIDE OF VALLEY. THE
TOP IS NOT ELAT, BUT BLATTISH, AND ABOUT 200-240 FEET ABOVE THE SNAKE. A DEFINITE CHANNEL
LEADING FROM SCABLANDS TO THE NORTH, CROSSES THIS DELTAIC TERRACE.
IT IS 30 TO 40 FEET DEEP
AND HAS A REAL KNOB OF BASALT IN IT OLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE SNAKE.
THE WHOLE SETTING
ANDICATES THAT THE LEVEL OF THE SNAKE WHEN TERRACE WAS DEPOSITED AND CHANNEL ERODED WAS AT LEAST
200 FEET ABOVE THE PRESINT JULY LEVEL. 09 OTHERWISE THE CHANNEL WOULD HAVE HAD A STEEPER GRADIENT
ACORSS THE DEPOSIT AND WOULD HAVE BITTEN MORE DEEPLY INTO BASALT BACK OF THE TERRACE
WITH THIS
AND OTHER EVIDENCE OF A SNAKE RIVER SURFACE 200 TO 250 GEET ABOVE THE PRESENT, THE DEEP SCABLAND
CHANNELS OF THE PALOUSE CANYON AND AN OPEN VALLEY AS DEEP AS AT PRESENT, SEEM OUT OF HARMONY.


THEY MUST HAVE A SPECIAL EXPLANATION.HAPPILY, A LOGICALONE SEEMS AVAILABLE. NO:TO
BA IT IS THAT THE BOLUME OF THE GLACIAL PALOUSE WAS SO GREAT AND ITS GRADIENT DOWN THE SLOPE
OF THE PREGLACIAL DIVIDE SO GREAT THAT IT ERODED FAR BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE FLOODED SNAKE.
THE HILL OF BASALT IN THE MOUTH OF THE PALOUSE IS ALL OF 400 FEET HIGH (FOR THE OW R AND N
BRIDGE IS MORE THAN 200) BUT IT IS OFF-CENTER CONSIDERABLY AND THE SMALLER CANYON WHICH HELPS
TO ISOLATE IT ISNT AS DEEPLY CUT AS THE CANYON ON THE EAST WHERE THE PALOUSE NOW FLOWS.
IT SEEMS
THAT A MINOR HIGH-GRADIENT TRIBUTARY DID ENTER THE SNAKE HERE, BUT THAT THE GLACIAL FLOOD WAS SO
GREAT THAT IT ERODED THE SUBSIDIARY CANYON As A PART OF THE SCABLAND COMPLEX. M via Te)

A SMALL FRACTION OF 1%.
ONLY 10 OR 12 PEBBLES, COBBLES AND BOULDERS OF NON-BASALT WERE SEEN

BUT ALONG THES LOWER TERRACE, WHERE THE SNAKE HAS PRESUMABLY WORKED OVER THE GRAVEL, ThE
PERCENTAGE OF FOREIGN MATERIAL RUNS AS HIGH AS 2% TO 3% (PEBBLE COUNTS) AND THIS NON-BASALT
CONTAINS A GREAT VARIETY OF ROCK NOT FOUND IN THE SCABLAND GRAVEL. MUCH DENSE SILiCEÖUS GREEN
MATERIAL, CONSPICUOUS PHANERITES AND PHOPHYRIES, IDENTIFY IT AS DERIVED FROM DRAINAGE AREAS WHICH

ON LO086- T368907 OM
A GREAT GRAVEL DEPOSIT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE SNAKE, EXTENDS FROM ABOUT THREE MILES ABOVE
ThE MOUTH OF THE PALOUSE ALMOST TO THE R JCT AT RIPARIA.
MUCH OF IT IS FLAT-TOPT AND FROM
200 TO 260 FEET ABOVE THE STREAM.
NO BAR FORM, As BETWEEN THE PALOUSE AND DEVILS CANYON. 099
AND THE FORESET BEDDING, AJ/MOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION, DIPS UP THE SNAKE. IN SOME PLACES THE
PERCENT OF FOREIGN (SNAKE RIVER) MATERIAL IS AS HIGH As 1/5 THE TOTAL, BUT THIS IS RARE. MOST
TAi
OF IT IS 99% OR MORE OF BASALT.
AND IT IS MUCH WORN AND WELLSORTED, IN GENERAL. O AND ITS
3A TEXTURE IS PROGRESSIVELY FINER WITH INGREASING DISTANCE UP THE SNAKE UNTIL, JUST WEST OF RIPARIA,
WHERE THE TERRACE TERMINATES UPSTREAM AT ABOUT 150 FEET ABOVE THE RIVER, THE MATERIAL IS, FINE
ENOUGH TO PUT ON RODS WiThOUT CRUSHING.
THIS ASSOCIATION OF UPSTREAM DIP OF FORESET BEDS
AND FINER GRADE IN SAME DIRECTION IS VERY SIGNIFICANT.

APPARENTLY, THE TWO WERE
ONCE A CONTINOUS DEPOSIT FOR THEIR SUMMITS ARE THE SAME ALTITUDE AND THE SNAKE LIES IN A RELA-
OF ATIVELY NARROW BALLEY HERE WITH LITTLE OR NO BASALT IN THE CLIFFS.. 77 THE TRIBUTARY VALLEY DEPOSIT
IS LOWER AND CLEARLY SLOPES DOWN, UP THE TRIBUTARY. WIT HAS COME FROM THE NORTH SIDE OF THE
SNAKE.

CONNECTION WITH SCABLAND TO THE NORTH IS IBDICATED BY. GRAVEL WITH A FEW GRANITES AND SCHISTS
WHICH DESCENDS FROM GAPS IN THE BASALT CLIFFS BACK OF (NORTH OF) THE BIG RERRACE. BUT THERE ARE
NO NOTEWORTHY CHANNELS CUT HERE AND MOST OF THE GRAVEL SEEMS TO HAVE EDDIED UP THE SNAKE FROM
A POINT NOT FAR ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE PALOUSE.
THE INTERPRETATION WHICH SEEMS BEST FOR THE
SITUATION IS THAT ThE SNAKE WAS PONDED ABOVE THE PALOUSE JUNCTION, IN PART BY THE ENORMOUS VOL-
UME OF THE GLACIAL PALOUSE AND IN PART BY ITS GREAT BAR DEPOSITS WHICH SOMEWHAT DEGREASED CAPACITY
OF THE MASTER VALLEY, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY A DELTA WAS BUILT HERE, EXTENDING UP THE SNAKE FOR
AT LEAST FIVE MILES. MOD ChA
MAST
IF THIS INTERPRETATION IS CORRECT, NO GREAT GRAVEL TERRACES SHOULD BE FOUND FOR SOME MILES
ABOVE RIPARIA, AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE PONDING EXTENDED.
BUT SILT DEPOSITS SHOULD EXIST, THO
NOT As HIgH ABOVE ThE STREAM.
THE LARGE PERCENTAGE OF FOREIGN M^TERIAL PROBABLY MEANS REWORKED SNAKE RIVER GRAVEL OR
PERHAPS A LATER REWORKING IN PART BY GHE SNAKE. da
IN THE LATTER CASE, HOWEVER, FORESET BEDS
SHOULD DIP DOWN THE STREAM, AND THIS IS RARELY, IF EVER, THE CRSE.
A TRAVERSE TOMORROW UP THE SNAKE ABOVE RIPARIA WILL AFFORD A CONCLUSIVE BEST OF THE INTER-
PRETATION HERE AdVAnCED.

THSS SURVEY OF SNAKE RIVER VALLEY NEEDS LITTLE, OF ANY, MORE TO MAKE THE CASE FOR A GREAT
SCABLAND FLOOD IN THE SNAKE VALLEY UNASSAILABLE.. SNAKE RIVER GRAVELS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM
SCABLAND GRAVELS. WA THEY OCCUR (ABOVE FLOODPLAINS AND LOW TERRACES) NO FARTHER DOWN THAN THE
SOUTH SEND OF RIPARIA BRIDGE. TANOTHE TERRACES WHICH THEY MAKE ARE NOWHERE MORE THAN 50 FT ABOVE
THE STREAM (DEDUCTING FOR AL.FAN AND TALUS ADDITIONS NEXT TO THE BLUFFS) AND IN MOST CASES ARE
40 FT OR LESS ABOVE THE SUMMER LEVEL.
HEIR ALTITUDE ABOVE THE RIVER IS GRADUALLY LESS WITH
INCREASING DISTANCE UP THE RIVER. A RIVER DROPS ABOUT 175 FT BETWEEN LEWISTON AND RIPARIA.
MATERIAL OF THE SNAKE RIVER TERRACES IS WELL ROUNDED AND WELL SORTED.
VOR
THE SCABBAND TERRACES ARE CHIEFLY GREAT BARS, WITH CONVEX TOPS.
THEY ARE MUCH HIGHER,
EXTENDING 100 TO 200 FEET ABOVE THE STREAM, THO NOT AS HIGH AS THE FLAT-TOPT TERRACES AssoCIATED
WITH THEM.
THREE SUCH TERRACES NOW LOCATED; ONE OPPOSITE DEVILS CANYON, ONE AT DAV IN AND ONE

VALLEY.
AT ONE PLACE ON EAST WALL Of THIS VALLEY, THE WHOLE SLOPE IS MANTLED WITH GRAVEL AS
THO THE ELOODED SNAKE HAD POURED OVER INTO IT HERE BECAUSE IT WAS COMPLETELY DAMNED JUST BELOW
RIPARIA.
ALTITUDE OF THIS GRAVEL OVER ThE EAST WALL APPEARS TO BE EVEN HIGHER THAN IN BIG
TERRACE BETWEEN PERRY AND RIPARIA.
THE EPISODE OF SCABLAND FLOODING WAS RELATIVELY SHORT AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF GRAVEL WAs
MADE RAPIDLY.
FLSE THE SNAKE WOULD HAVE RAISED ITS BED WITH ITS OWN GRAVEL, ABOVE RIPARIA, TO
EQUIVALENT ALTITUDES.
WHETHER THE SNAKE RIVER TERRACES ABOVE RIPARIA ARE OF THE SAME AGE
AS THE SCABLANDS, OR OLDER OR YOUNGER, ISNT CLEAR.

THERE IS NOTHING INHERENTLY | HARMONIOUS IN THE ENTIRE EXPLANATION. NOR IS THERE ANYTHING
CONTRADICTARY IN THE FIELD EVIDENCE. NOR ANYTHING LACKING, EXCEPT SILT DEPOSITS ABOVE RIPARIA.
ONE FEATURE, HOWEVER, REMAINS UNEXPLAINED. IT IS THE UPSTREAM DIP OF THE FOESET BEDDING EAST
OF RIPARIA. THIS IS LACKING IN THE SCABBAND GRAVEL BELOW PERRY, WHERE THE DIP IS DOWN THE
VALLEY CONSISTENTLY. I IT IS PRESENT IN THE SCABLAND GRAVEL ABOVE PERRY, WHERE THE HYPOTHESIS
PERMITS IT; ALMOST REQUIRES IT. BUT WHY SHOULD IT APPEAR IN THE SNAKE RIVER GRAVELS ABOVE TBE
INFLUENCE OF THE SCABLAND DEPOSITS AND CURRENTS? O THERE IS NO POSSIBLITY OF REVERSING THE
SNAKE. EVEN THO THIS MIGHT BE DONE, AND THE STREAM ABOVE RIPARIA DURING THE SOKANE FLOOD MIGHT
HAVE FLOWED TO THE COLUMBIA BY WAY, SAY, OF THE WESTWARD EXTENSION OF THE LEWISTON SUNCLINE (TO
WHERE?) THE REVERSED STREAM COUNDNT CONSTRUCT AN UPHILL SET OF TERRACES NOR COULD IT BE SUPPLIED
WITH ITS OWN CHARACTERISTIC GRAVEL. TE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE QUANDRY IS TO EXPLAIN ALL THESE
AS EDDIES IN WHICH A BACK-SETTING CURRENT DEPOSITEC THE GRAVEL - WHICHSEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO
APPLY EXCEPT IN RARE CASES- I TO CALL THE FOREST BEDDING IMBRICATED ON THE UPCURRENT SLOPES
OF ACCRETING BARS-OR TO FIND SOMETHING NEW IN BAR GROWTH groso)
_ THE IMBRICATION HYPOTHESIS FALLS DOWN WHERE SANDALSO IS FORESET BEDDED UPSTREAM, ESPECIALLY
WHERE THAT SAND (OR A LAYER OF SAND) IS THIN AND LIES ABOVE AND BELOW HORIZONALLY BEDDED SILTS.
AT PRESENT THE PHENOMENON IS A DEP PUZZLE, THO ITS ONLY EFFECT ON THE HISTORY | AM HERE EDGEAVOR -
ING TO CONSTUCT IS TO WEAKEN THE ARGUMENT FOR A DELTA ABOVE PERRY AND BELOW PERRY, A DELTA IN A
PONDED SNAKE OR A GREATLY FLOODED SNAKE, WITH BACKWATER FROM THE GLACIAL PALOUSE AND OTHER SPOKANE

EUREKA FLAT IS A CURIOUS, ALMOST AN ANOMALOUS, AREA AMONG THE MUCH DISSECTED LOESSIAL HILLS.
IT ISNT FLAT, IT IS DISSECTED BY A DRAINAGE PATTERN, BUT SHALLOWLY INTRENCHED. THE ONLY RELA-
TIONSHIP THE WATERWAYS BEAR TO IT IS THAT THEY FOLLOW IN GENERAL ITS LINEAR EXTENT. SOME HEAD
ON ONE SIDE AND CROSS TO THE OTHER, SOME ARE MARGINAL BETWEEN HIGHER HILLS AND THE FLAT, ANd SOME
ENTER IT FROM THE HILLS, SOME LEAVE IT FOR THE HILLS AND ONE (TOUCHET RIVER) ENTERS, FLOWS MARGIN-
ALLY FOR A FEW MILES AND THEN LEAVES. IT. THE FLAT IS AT LEAST 25 MILES LONG, ELONGATED IN
PARALLELISM WITH THE PECULIAR LINEAR DRAINAGE PATTERN OF THE REGION, SLOPES 500 FT ALONG ITS

THE MOST SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION FOR EUREKA FLAT IS THAT IT IS AN UNDISSECTED REMNANT OF
THE ORIGINAL LOESS COVER AND THAT IT HAS ESCAPED DISSECTION BECAUSE OF ITS LOW GRADIENT AND THE
STEEPENED GRADIENTS OF ADJACENT, SLIGHTLY UPFOLDED TRACTS.

400 FT A.T. AND WAS AN OPEN VALLEY WHEN OCCUPIED. IT NOR WAS THIS PONDING, FOR THE WATERS CARRIED
HUGE AMOUNTS OF BASALT GRAVEL AND ERODED THE BASALT LEDGES IN TYPICAL SCABLAND FORMS. ALL THE
FEATURES OF SCABLAND ARE HERE. BLUFFS OF LOESS WITH 30° SLOPES FACE THE SCABLAND AREAS. 37
ISOLATED LOESSIAL HILLS WTH PROWS ARE HERE. CLIFFS OF THE SCABLAND, FACING AwAY FROM THE

THE ROUNDED FORMS SO OFTEN SEEN IN THE PLATEAU SCABLANDS LIE IN PROTECTED PLACES, INSIDE CURVES

GOOD SECTIONS IN IT BUT IT IS ALMOST ALL BASALT GRAVEL. ANOTHER BAR IN THE SOUTH PART OF A
SECTION 23, 11N., 33E., AND NORTH PART OF SECTION 26 IS RINGED BY THE 800 FT CONTOUR AND EXTENDS
DOWN TO THE RIVER LEVEL. IT IS 400 FEET THICK. THE SP AND S RR CUT IN IT EXPOSES AT LEAST

IT IS ABSOLUTELY
CONVINCING TO ME AND I SHALL NEVER AgAIN HESITATE IN MY STATEMENTS ABOUT THE ENORMOUS VOLUME OF
WATER CARRIED ACROSS THE PRATEAU AND INTO THE SNAKE DURING THE SPOKANE EPISODE. NO ONE WITH
AN EYE TRAINED FOR PHYSIOGRAPHIC FORMS CAN BESIST THE ArGUMENT PRESENTED IN THIS VIEW.

THE SITUATION IN SNAKE RIVER VALLEY IS ABNORMAL, CLEARLY.

PORTION OF ITS WATERS ACORSS SOME DIVIDE IN ASOTIN OR GARFIELD COUNTY, OR IN OREGON SOUTH OF THESE

TUCANNON OR WALLA WALLA WOULD ONLY LEAD SUCH WATER BACK TO THE ORIGINAL POND. THE WAY THE
UPPER LIMIT OF THE SCABLAND ALONG THE SNAKE REMAINS CLOSE TO 1000, 1050 AND 1100 SUGGESTS THAT

THE PORTLAND DELTA
SUNDAY
JULY 27 1924
THE PORTLAND DELTA IS A SUBAQUEOUS DEPOSIT, AN AFFAIR OF RIVER-BOTTOM DEPOSITION, AND IS
NOT A DELTA PLAIN.
INSTEAD OF DISTRIBUTARIES WHICH ERODED INTO THE PLAIN WHEN THE BASE-LEVEL
WAS LOWERED DURING THE DELTA GROWTH (AS MY EARLIER INTERPRETATIONS HAD IT), THESE BROAD WATER-
WAYS OF THE COLUMBIA ARE CHANNELS HELD OPEN WHILE THE HIGHER PARTS WHICH SEPARATE THEM WERE
AGGRADED AS GREAT BARS. M AHTY ASK DRIODI
TOO DATA
THE EVIDENCE FOR THE ABOVE STATEMENT IS FOUND IN MOJA 29419
1- THE CHARACTER OF THE BARS ON
ICEHO ARRI
2- THE SITUATION AT ROCKY BUTTER ANT HEY
3- THE DEMANDS OF THE SPOKANE BARS AND SCABLAND DOWN THE COLUMBIA BELOW WALLULA.
() THERE ARE TWO FAIRLY CONSISTENT LEVELS IN THE PORTLAND DELTA; THE HIGHEST IS 300 FT.,
THE LOWEST IS 200. FEET. ST. # AT THE 300-F00T LEVEL OCCUR BROAD FLATS AND NARROW ELONGATE RIDGES,
AT THE 200-FOOT LEVEL OCCUR BROAD FLATS AND FAIRLY RESTRICTED CHANNELS. THE TWO LEVELS OF FLATS
LED TO THE ORIGINAL INTERPRETATION OF DISSECTION OF AN ORIGINALLY CONTINUOUS 300-FOOT LEVEL.
BUT IF THIS WERE CORRECT, THE NARROW RIDGES STANDING APPROXIMATELY ON THE 200 FOOT LEVEL AND
RISING CONSISTENTLY TO THE 300-FOOT LEVEL MUST BE REMNANTS LEFT BY EROSION. AS TO WHETHER THEY
ARE SUCH, THE REGION OF HIDDEN, THREE MILES NORTHEAST OF VANCOUVER, SUPPLIES THE FIELD DATA.
1 a (A) THE RIDGES ARE LONG AND /NARROW. H THE MOST STRIKING ONE, 1/2 MILES DOUTH OF
HIDDEN, IS 1 1/2 MILeS DONg AND ABOUT 300 FEET WIDE ON TOP. AND WHERE THE PORTLAND QUADRANGLE
SEEMS TO SHOW A GREATER WIDTH TO SOME, FIELD INSPECTION SHOWS THAT TO BE DUE TO CLOSE POSITION
AND PARTIAL COALESCENCE OF TWO OR THREE PARALLEL RIDGES. ALICA ANON SHADE
30A (B) HE RIDGES ARE COMPOSED OF FORESET-BEDDED SAND AND BB-SHOT-SIZED GRAVEL.
NOT
MANY SECTIONS AVAILABLE BUT THESE SHOWED THE DIP TO SE DOWN THE NORTH SLOPE, IN PARALLELISM
WITH THAT SLOPE, AND TO BE TRUNCATED BY THE TOP AND SOUTH SLOPE.
RURTHER, THE DIP SLOPE IS
THE STEEPER SLOPE.U aNT DO TOSW TART GMA TOAS TART
цИа
(c) BB GRAVEL, BY COUNT, IS 7% NON- BASALT. aMT
мАзята тазда
(D) VALLEYS BETWEEN RIDGES CONTAIN PONDS, SWAMPS AND LAKES NOT STREAMS.
(E) RIDGES ARE GROUPED ABOUT THE EDGE OF THE 200-FOOT LEVEL, NEAR HIDDEN, AND PO/ KTI
ARE ORIENTED AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE EDGE OF THE DEPOSIT. JATHE MOST DISTANT P IS THE GROUP OF
THREE IN ENT CENTRAL PART OF SECTION 33, RIE., TIN. 3 NO GRAVEL IN THIS IS SHOWN- ALL SAND.
THESE RIDGES ARE THEREFORE HELD TO BE RIVER BARS, ABOUT 100 FEET HIGH ABOVE THE MAIN
CHANNEL FLOORS AND 50-75 FEET HIGH ABOVE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS.
(2) ROCKY BUTTE IS CLIFFED ABOUT THE LOWER SLOPES ON THE EAST SIDE AND NORTH END.
AN
ELONGATED DEPRESSED AREA LIES CLOSE TO THE BASE OF THE EAST SIDE AND SOUTH END AND ANOTHER TRAILS
OFF TO THE WEST, DEPENDENT FROM THE SOUTH END.
DIRECTLY WEST OF THE BUTTE IS A GRAVEL DEPOSIT
75 FT + ABOVE THE ELONGATED DEPRESSIONS AND ITSELF ELONGATED EAST-WEST.
THE ENSEMBLE. IS
NOW CLEARLY SEEN AS THE PHENOMENON OF A PRONOUNCED ISOLATED OBSTRUCTION IN THE PATH OF A GRAVEL-
CARRYING STREAM.
THE CURRENT IS DEFLECTEDOUKON
FROM THE UPSTREAM SIDE AND KEEPS A NARROW EDDY
DEPRESSION UNFILLED.
IT ALSO IS DEFLECTED AROUND THE ENDS AND CARRIES THE DEPRESSION DONSTREAM
FOR A MILE IN THIS CASE.
THE IMPINGING CURRENT ERODED THE UPSTREAM SIDE AND PRODUCED THE
LOWER CLIFFS WHICH ON THE NORTH SIDE ARE SHARPLY CUT IN ORIGINALLY GENTLER SLOPES AND DO NOT RISE
ABOVE 300 FY A.T.
THE DEPOSIT OF GRAVEL ON THE WEST OF THE BUTTE IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF CURRENT


CHECKING ON THE LONER DOWN-STREAM SIDE.
THE ENSEMBLE IS IN PERFECT HARMONY, BUT A STREAM
WHOSE UPPER SURFACE WAS AT LEAST 300 FT A.T. AND WHOSE DEPTH ABOUT THE BUTTE WAS 100 FEET IS
REQUIRED.
13V. (3) AB RELATIONS TO THE SPOKANE GRAVEL AND SCABLANDS UP THE COLUMBIA.
IN PERFECT ACCORD
WITH THE DEMANDS FOR A HUGE VOLUME OF WATER OVER THE PORTLAND DELTA, AT ONLY PUZZLING THING ABOUT
IT IS THE UPPER LIMIT OF THIS STREAM. O| FROM THE FACT THAT THE UPPER FLATS ARE 300 FT + A.T..
AND MOST OF THE BARS BISE TO 300+, ONLY TWO OF THEM EXCEEDING 325 (THE HIGHEST IS 3504), AND
FROM THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE CLIFFS ALONG NORTH SIDE OF ROCKY BUTTE, IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT THE
SPOKANE FLOOD NEVER REACHED MUCH ABOVE 300 HERE, NOT TO EXCEED 350. (PERHAPS THE EXTRA
25 FT ON THE 350-FOOT KNOB IS A DUNE.
YET IF THE FLOOD WAS NOT ABOVE 350 FT A.T. AT PTLO.
AND YET REACHED 670 FT AT WHITE SALMON, THE SLOPE OF THE SURFACE OF THIS RIVER WAS INCONCEIVABLY
STEEP FOR SO GREAT A STREAM. EITHER THE LOOD WAS DEEPER AT PORTLAND, OR THERE HAS BEEN SOME
O FFERENTIAL MOVEMENT, SINCE THE BARS WERE DEPOSITED. O THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS TO ACCEPT A
GRADE OF 6 FEET TO THE MILE FOR THE SURFACE OF THE SPOKANE COLUMBIA THRU THE GORGE.

STUDY OF THE PTLD SHEET SHOWS THAT THE BAR DOWNSTREAM FROM ROCKY BUTTE HAS A LONG GENTLE
SLOPE ON THE NORTHEN SIDE AND A STEEP SCARP ON THE SOUTH, ENDING IN THE E- DEPRESS@ON THERE.
AFTER SEEING THIS TRACT AGAIN IN THE FIELD, OR THINKING OVER THE VISUAL IMPRESSIONS GAINED IN
1924 BUT NOT RECORDED, I HAVE THIS TO ADD.
3017 733= C96
ABOOTH
THERE ARE FOREST STRATA IN THE HIGHWAY CUT THAT CROSSES THIS SCARP WEST OF RKY BUTTE• Ya
THEY DIP WITH THE SCARP SLOPE, SOUTHWARD. O THERE ARE MINOR FLUTINGS AND BARLIKE FORMS ON THE
GENTLE NORTHERN SLOPE OF THIS BAR JUST LIKE THOSE ON THE NORTHERN SLOPE OF THE 300 FT TERRACE
EAST OF THE EDDY FOSSE. SEEN IN THE FIELD, THEY LOOK MUCH MORE LIKE ACCRETIONAL FORMS THAN
LIKE EROSIONAL/ RESULTS.IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOUNT READILY FOR THEM AS EROS /ONAL FORMS. I
THEREFORE THE NORTHERN SLOPE OF BOTH BARS, THAT EAST AND THAT WEST OF THE BUTTE, IS THE ORIGINAL
SLOPE As LEFT BY THE GREAT STREAM.
THE FOREST BEDS DIPPING SOUTHWARD AROUND THE WEST END
OF RIY BUTTE RECORD THE GROWing BACE OF ThE BAR THAT WAS BUILT BY THE SOUTHWARD SURGE WHEN THE
WATERS ZER PASSEPHE BUTTE. V34 THE DELTA THEREFORE ISNT A DISSECTED FORM IN ANY SENSE (EXCEPT
AS SMALL GULLIES EXIST). 19 Ta

FORESET LAMINAE, ORDINARY CURRENT TYPE, IN HORIZONTAL STRATA.
NO LONG DELTA
FORESETS.
UP TO ABOUT SAME LEVEL FROM HOOD RIVER WEST TO RUTHTON GRADE, THE SLOPES BEAR
QUANTITIES OF LARGE ROLLED BOULDERS OF THE UNDERLYING HERMAN CREEK LAVA.
ABOVE THIS LEVEL,
THE ORCHARD LAND IS SOIL-COVERED, UNTERRACED, UNBROKEN BY OUTCROPS OF ROCK AND WITHOUT ANY
BOULDERS.
IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE WHITE SALMON BAR AT 670 FT. A.T., THIS WOULD DO NICELY FOR
THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE SPOKANE FLOOD.

JULY 30 1924
ALONG HIGHWAY ON SOUTH SIDE, BETWEEN HOOD RIVER AND MOSIER, THERE ARE CASTELLATED CRAGS
WITH LINEAR CHANNELS SEPARATING THEM FROM THE MAIN HILLSIDE UP AT LEAST TO 400 FT A. T. (AS TR
HIGH AS THE HIWAY GOES HERE.
THESE CRAGS ARE AS SEVERELY ERODED ON THE SIDE TOWARD THE HILL
AS THEY ARE ON THE COLUMBIA SIDE.
THE CLIFFS BEAR TALUS ABOUT 3/4 UP.
THIS AI
THESE CRAGS AND CHANNELS ArE AS CLEARLY A RECORD OF THE SPOKANE FLOOD AS ANYTHING IN THE A
BRUTA SN
MA m IN
GORGE.
ROWENA MESA NO JULY 30 1924 A9 BIT 38 MANS TASER
SCABBAND ALONG COLUMBIA RIVER HIWAY IS WELL EXPRESSED UP TO 700 FT A.T.
BUTTES OF THE
DALLES FORMATION, DESCRIBED IN NOTES OF PREVIOUS FIELD SEASONS, ARE THE EROSIONAL PRODUCT OF THE
SPOKANE FLOOD.019 IF THEY WERE NORMAL AFFAIRS OF SUBAERIAL DEGRADATION, THEY WOULD EXIST WELL
DISTRIBUTED OVER THE AREA OF THE FORMATION, FOR SLOPES ELSEWHERE ARE ADEQUATELY STEEP.
IF THBY
WERE DUE TO SUPERIOR EROSION bY THE COLUMBIA DOWN IN THE GORGE HERE, ONLY THE RIVEDWARD SLOPES
WOULD BEAR THE MESA CHARACTER.
THIs 700-T ALTITUDE AGREES WITH THE 670 FT WHITE SALMON BAR.
SEEN FROM THE ROWEN MESA AND THE HIWAY NEARER THE DALLES TOWN, THE ORTLEY ANTICLINE ON THE
NORTH SIDE OF ThE RiVER IS SEVERELY ERODED UP TO 500 FT OR SO ABOVE THE RIVER.
BARE, BLACK ROCK
AND EXEEED INGLY ROUGH SURFACES BELOW THIS LEVEL ARE IN STRIKING CONTRAST WITH THE GRASSED SLOPES
OF ABOUT THE SAME GRADIENT ABOVE THIS LEVEL.
THE RUGGED BASALT FLAT NORTH OF GRAND DALLES MIGHT BE TRA&SPLANTED DIRECTLY FFOM THE
SCABEANDS OF THE PLATEAU.
IT IS IDENTICAL IN EVERY RESPECT !
A LONE ISOLATED HILL, PROBABLY
OF DALLES BEDS, CERTAINLY WITH GENTLER SLOPES THAN B88ALT WOULD HAVE, STANDS AT UPPER LIMIT OF
THE BASALT FLAT, JUST SOUTH OF THE GREAT SHOULDER PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED (FORMER YEARS) AS OF
COLUMBIA BASALT.
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE A RELICT HILL.


STACKER BUTTE
JULY 30 1924
BEEN FROM THE OW R AND N, THE GREAT TALUS OR WASTE SLOPE OF STACKER BUTTE, EAST OF THE
" BLUE LAVA? FLOW FROM SUMMIT VOLCANO, IS SHARPLY TRUSATED ALONG THE LOWER EDGE JUST ABOVE THE
SCABLAND BASALT.
AND GULLIES HAVE TRENCHED DEEPLY INTO IT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS TRUINCA-
TION.
THIS CAN ONLY BE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE SPOKANE FLOOD.
ALTITUDE OF THE SCARP A. T.
UNKNOWN BUT APPROXIMATELY 500 FT ABOVE THE RIVER.
ROOSEVELT FLAT, JUST WEST OF
JULY 30 1924
WHAT LOOKS LIKE A ONCE COMPLETE VALLEY BLOCKING OF THE FIRST PROMINENT DRIBUTA BELOW
ROOSEVELT FLAT IS VERY CONSPICUOUS FROM SOUTH SIDE.

ALTITUDE NOT TO EXCEED 400 M.T.)
ON RR AND N$ CUT-OFF, MESSER TO STANFIELD
JULY 30 1924
THE ENTIRE ROUTE IS ALMOST FEATURELESS.
A MANTLE OF COARSE SAND COVERS IT AND THE SLOPES
ARE VERY GENTLE•
ONLY THREE CUTS SHOW ANYHING MORE THAN SAND AND ONLY ONE TOPOGRAPHIC
FEATURE OF SIGNIFICANCE WAS SEEN.
THE CUTS REFERRED TO EXOSE GRAVEL.
THIS GRAVEL IS 09
COARSE AND CONTAINS AN ABUNDANCE OF LIGHT-COLORED MATERIAL.
IT HARDLY SEEMS POSSIBLE TO MAKE
IT SPOKANE GRAVEL.
NOR DOES. IT LOOK STAINED OR DISCOLORED, AS IS THE STANFIELD AND ECHO
GRAVEL.
NOR IS IT INDURATED, AS THAT IS.
I DONT KNOW WHERE IT BELONGS UNLESS IT IS
MATERIAL ALREADY ON THE GROUND, REWORKED BY THE SPOKANE FLOOD.
HIGHEST ALTITUDE CROSSED WAS
ABOUT 600. 07 302
100900904
THE TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURE OF INTEREST IS A SCARP, FACING WESTWARD FROM A GRAVEL FLAT 600/650
FEET IN ALTITUDE. @ THE SCARP IS ABOUT. 50 FT HIGH.
ARR OUT SHOWS THE GRAVEL BENEATH THE
FLAT, THO THE R SWINGS PRETTY WELL SOUTH OF THE MEATURE. IT LOOKS L/K AS THO IT MIGHT BE
A DOWNSTREAM, SCARP OF A HUGE BAR, BUILT BY WATERS OF THE SPOKANE FLOOD WHICH SWUNG WESTWARD
ACrOSS THE GREAT FLAT OF THIS PART OF THE BLALOCK LOWLAND.
BUT THIS IS NOT A GOOD, CLEAR
CASES AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN BUILDING THE ARGUMENT FOR THE SPOKANE FLOOD.
UMATILLAA HERMISTON AX$/EN XX*/BUTTES ARE SEVERELY SCOURED, EMIGRANT BUTTE HAS * GENTLE
GRADED SLOPES.
THIS IS BECAUSE IT STOOD BACK FROM THE PATH OF THE SPOKANE FLOOD, AND PERHAPS

B. VICINITY OF STANFIELD, GOLD SPRINGS RESERVOIR AND HERMISTON
UMATILLA SHEET
JULY 30 1924
AN INDURATED GRAVEL CONSTITUTES THE TERRACE JUST NORTH OF ECHO.
TERRACE IS 800, THE GRAVEL IS EXPOSED AS LOW ALMOST #S THE R GRADE.
THE SUMMIT OF THE

GRAVEL MUST BE 100 FT

SAME GRAVEL NORTH OF STANFIELD. (FOSTER), EXPOSED ALONG R AND HIWAY.
AS SHOWN BY TRAVERSE
FROM STANFIELD TO C-S RESERVOIR, THE BROAD, ROLLING PLAIN AT 700-750 IS DOUBTLESS ALL UNDERLAIN
BY THIS SAME GRAVEL.
MO SCARS OR EXPOSURES ALONG THE TRAVERSE BUT PLENTY OF GRAVEL AND LIMY
* INTERSTITIAL MATERIAL ALONG THE ROAD AND AMONG THE SAGE.
-G. INCIDENTALLY, A LOT OF GRANITIC
ERRATICS UP TO 750.

DAM AT THE C-S RESERVOIR IS BUILT ON A BASALT FOUNDATION BUT IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE DAM;
9027
NO BASALT IS SEEN ANYWHERE IN THE GULCHES.
THEY ARE ALL IN THIS GRAVEL FORMATION.
KNOBS OF
BASALT APPEAR IN HERMISTON BUTTE AND UMATILLA BUTTE, SEVEN AND EIGHT MILES TO THE WESTWARD, BUT
ELSEWHERE IS THE GRAVEL PLAIN, SCORED BY EROSION BUT ESSENTIALLY INTACT AND CONTINUOUS. THIS
PLAIN PROBABLY EXTENDS NORTHWARD NEARLY TO THE COLUMBIA BLUFFS, THEMSELVES OF BASALT .
IN OTHER
WORDS, THERE IS A BROAD LOW TRACT IN THE BASALT HERE, FILLED WITH GRAVEL, LYING ON AN ERODED
SURFACE (WITNESS HERMISTON AND UMATILLA BUTTES)
THE BEST SECTION OF THE GRAVEL IS BELOW THE C S DAM WHERE EXTENSIVE EXCAVATING WAS MADE WEEN
THE DAM WAS CONSTRUCTED.
THE GRAVEL IS FRESH, EXCEPT FOR LIMEY INCRUSTATIONS AND PARTIAL
CEMENTATION.
IT IS COMPOSED LARGELY OF BASALT.
THERE IS SOME QTZITE IN IT !
IF THE
SECTION WERE SEEN IN THE GORGE, ITS COLOR, STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITON WOULD CONVINCE ONE THAT IT
BELONGED TO THE PORTLAND DELTA.
IT IS MORE INDURATED NEAR ECHO AND STANFIELD THAN THE
PORTLAND DELTA BUT AT THE C-S RESERVOIR IT IS NOT INDURATED AT ALL.
NOWHERE IS IT STAINED
THESE
OR DECOMPOSED.
NOWHERE DOES IT SHOW ANyDEFORMATION. NO AsH FOUnd IN IT.
IN ALL,WAYS
IT RESEMBLES PD GRAVEL VERY CLOSELY.
ESCEPT FOR ALTITUDES AND THE CEMENTATION NEAR ECHO AND
STANFIELD, IT IS PD.
AND THE ALTITUDE OF 750 MAY WELL FALL INTO THE ASCENDING GRADIENT OF
THE PD X6 UPSTREAM.
FURTHER, THE INDURATION IS NOT A FATAL OBJECTION.
THE PRESENCE OF OTZITES IS WHOLLY OUT OF HARMONY WITH THE SATSOP-DALLES-ARLINGTON DEPOST.
IT HAS NONE OF THE CHARACTERS OF THAT DEPOSIT.
IN THE LIGHT OF PRESENT KNOWLEDGE, IT IS PD,
NOT SATSOP.
IF FURTHER INVESTIGATION CAN BE MADE, THE DEPOSIT SHOULD BETRACED EASTWARD, IF
IT RISES ON THE SLOPE OF THE ANTICLINE (WALLULA GATEWAY FOLD) IT IS SATSOP.
IF IT ABUTS
AGAINST THE BASALT, AS IT APPEARS TO DO AT THE C-S DAM, IT IS PD.
THIS IS THE DEPOSIT WHICH YIELDED THE ELEPHAS COLUMBI TOOTH, REPORTED BY WHISTLER TO HAY,
AND PROBABLY THE CAMEL VERTEBRA AS WELL.
WHISTLER SAYS THE CAMEL VERTEBRA WAS FOUND ON
BEDROCK AT LEAST 100 FT BELOW THE HIGHEST BASALT HERE.
THIS CAN ONLY MEAN THAT THE GRAVEL
LIES AGAINST A SLOPING SURFACE OF THE BASALT, AS ABOVE SUGGESTED.
HERMISTON AND UMATILLA BUTTES_ RISE 120 AND 175 FT RESPECTIVELY ABOVE THE RIVER FLOOD PLAIN.
THEY ARE IRREGULAR KNOBS OF BASALT, LEFT BY THE EROSION OF THE COLUMBIA ACROSS THIS LOWLAND TRACT.
THEY ARE IDENT@CAL WITH ROCKY ISLANDS NOW IN THE COLUMBIA CHANNEL IN PLACES.
THE COLUMBIA
SWUNG ACROSS HERE, REMOVED FROM 100 TO 175 FT OF ROCK IN PLACES, THEN FILLED THE WHOLE WITH
GRAVEL, AND LATER ASSISTED THE MATILLA IN THE PARTIAL REMOVAL WHICH HAS OCCURRED SUBSEQUENTLY.
((INSERT SOME TIME LATER- NO! THESE BUTTES ARE LOCAL UPWARPS) ))
FOUR MILE GAP IS AN OLD


CHANNEL OF THE COLUMBIA, SIMILAR TO THOSE SOUTH OF ARLINGTON.
BUT NO DELTA HERE AS IN
ALKALI CANYON.
3 JESS
SOMETHING IS WRONG IN THESE COMPARISONS !!
THE GRAVEL DEPOSIT WITH CHANNELS OF THE
COLUMBIA ACROSS IT AND A DELTA AT THEIR MOUTHS AT ARLISGTON IS A SATSOP DEPOSIT, AnD THE CHANN-
ELS AND BELTA ARE PD.
SO SHOULD THE HERMISTON GRAVEL BAAIN WITH ITS CHANNELS BE SATSOP AND
PD.
BUT THE PRECEDING ARGUMENT IS THAT THE PLAIN IS PD AND THE CHANNELS STILL YOUNGER.
YET THE PD AT PORTLAND HAS CHANNELS ACROSS IT !!
ANOTHER PUZZLE IS TO EXPLAIN THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PD TERRACES, 600 AT MARYHILL,
700 AT ARLINGTON, 750 AT STANFIELD (FOSTER) AND THE LOW TERRACES ABOVE THE WALLULA GATEWAY.
THE BROAD PLAIN WEST OF UMATILLA RIVER ON THE UMATILLA QUAD. IS DOUBTLESS THE SAME GRAVEL
PLAIN.
RIOM THE LOOKS OF THE BLALOOK SLAND MAP, THIS PLAIN IS CONTINUED WESTWARD TO THE ARE
ARLINGTON DEPOSIT.
THEN ETHER THE ARLINGTON-SATSOP AND THE HERMISTON-SUPPOSED-DD ARE THE
TARAS OH
SAME, OR TWO FORMATIONS UNDERLIE THE SAME PLAIN.
