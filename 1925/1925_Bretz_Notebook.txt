DRIFTED FRATICS IN COEUR D'ALENE LAKE VALLEY
JULY 22 1925
TRAVERSE MADE FROM ROCKFORD TO HUNTER'S LANDING.
LOESS IAL SOIL ALL THE WAS ACROSS TO THE
BRINK OF THE VALLEN.
BASALT BENEATH.
ALTITUDES ABOUT 2750.
APPARENTLY THE BASALT FLOWS
ENTERED CA LENE VALLEY MORE EXTENSIVELY BY THIS BOUTE THAN BY WAY OF SPOKANE RIVER VALLEY.
MATURE TOPOGRAPHY ON THE DIVIDES IS NOT DEEPLY INCISED AND HILLS ARE FLATTISH ON TOP.
NO TRACE
OF ANY GLACIAL SPILL ACROSS.
POSSIBLE THAT A ROUTE FARTHER EAST, EAST OF THE BIG, PRE BASALT
HILLS ESISTS.
IT WOULD HAVE TO LEAD OUT OF THE ST. JOE RIVER VALLEYS AND WOULD HAVE TO KEEP
EAST OF MOSCOW FOR THERE IS NO TRACE OF SUCH A SPILL BETWEEN MOSCOW AND SPOKANE.
DESCENT TO CDALENE LAKE IS ALMOST PRECIPITOUS.
ONLO STEEP RAVINES LEAD DOWN .
IN THE ONE
FOLLOWED BY THE ROAD, NO ERRQTIC MATERIAL ABOVE 2700.
BUT BELOW THAT ALTITUDE, AT ABOUT 2550.
WERE FOUND TAITE, VEIN OTZ, VARIOUS GRANITOIDS AND COARSE GRAINED BASIC ROCK FRAGMENTS, MOST OF
THEM AS WORN PEBBLES.
THIS RECORDS THE SAME PONDED WATER THAT FILLED SPOKANE VALLEY EAST OF
THE CITY OF SPOKAnE.
ALTITUDE AT CLARKIA, ON MILWAUKEE BRANCH LINE, SOUTHEAST OF COALENE LAKE Is 2828 FT. A. T.
AND THIS WERE IM TEN MILES NORTE. OF THE BIVIDE BETWEEN THE ST. JOE AND THE DRAINAGE TO THE SNAKE,
THIS IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE ROUTE OUT OF COALENE VALLEY TO THE SOUTH AND OBVIOUSLY IS TOO HIGH.
THE SCABLAND FLOOD NEVER USED CDALENE LAKE AS A ROUTE,

GRAND COULEE
JULY 24 1925
THE WHITE SILTS OF UPPER GRAND COULEE NOWHERE CARRY GOOD TERRACE TOPS.
THE DEPOSIT ALONG THE
ALMIRA ROAD AT THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE COULEE AND THE COLUMBIA IS A TERRACE, LIKE THOSE SEEN IN THE
DISTANCE DOWN THE COLUMBIA BUT ELSEWHERE IN THE COULEE ALL REMNANTS ARE CONSIDERABLY ERODED .
PLENTY OF RAVINES AND VALLEYS IN THEM AND THE WAIN COULEE CHANNEL THRU TBEM SO THAT THEY ARE BUT
LATERAL OR MARGINAL REMNANTS OF WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A CONTINUOUS FILL AT ONE TIME.
THE MAJOR PART OF THE DEPOSIT HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT BY A RIVER THRU GRAND COULEE. BOTH
SIDES OF STEANBOAT ROCK WERE OLFARED AND A LONG MEDIAN RIDSE OF THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN LEFT BEhold y)
THE ROCKWHERE IT WAS PROTECTED FROM THE CURRENT FROM THE NORTH.
WHEN WAS THIS SILT DEPOSITED AND WHEN WAS IT ERODED?
ITS EXISTENCE NORTH OF STEAMBOAT
ROCK AND THE GRANITE KNOBS AND RIDGES SHOWS THAT IT IS POST- THE GLACIAL ICE WHICH OVERRODE ALL OF
THEM (EXCEPT ON EXTREME EAST SIDE OF THE WALLEYCOULEE).
IF THE GLACIATION OF THESE KNOBS AND OF
SEAMBOAT ROCK IS WISCONSIN, THEN HE FINAL CURRENT THRU THE COULEE MUST HAVE FD LLOWED A SLACK-
WATER STAGE, ITSELF#POST WISCONSIN GLACIATION.
AND THE FRESHNESS AND STRENGTH OF DEVELOP@ENT
OF THE MORAINE ON STEAMBOAT ROCK SEEMS TO ADMIT OF ONLY ONE INTERPRETATION AS TO AGE THAT IT IS
WI SCON SUM.
A SPLENDID BAR, APPARENTLY WISCON&N IN AGE, LIES IN AN ALCOVE IN THE COULEE@S EAST WALL, JUST
SOUTH OF THE FAIRLY CONTINUOUS GRANITE RIDGE NEAR OSCAR OSBORNE'S RANCH.
THIS IS THE NORTHERN
OF THE TWO RIDGES WHICH TRANSECT THE UPPER COULEE.
IT IS ABOUT 150 FEET ABOVE THE COULEE FLOOR


HERE AND PERHAPS 50 FEET ABOVE THE ALBOVE FLOOR BACK OF THE BAR.
ITS SHAPE IS VERY GOOD, THOUGH
DRAINAGE FROM THE ALCOVE BASIN HAS CUT AWAY ONE SIDE SOMEWHAT.
IT CANNOT BE ANYTHING BUT A BAR.
IT IS COMPOSED OF OPEN GRAVEL.
ON ITS SURFACE ARE NUMEROUS GRANITIC GRAGMENTS, LARGE AND ANGULAR
DERIVED FROM THE RIDGE ON WHICH IT RESTS IN PART.
FINE GRAVEL BARS WERE BUILT ON THE COULEE FLOOR JUST NORTH Of THIS RIDGE
THEY TERMINATE A
FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM THE RIDGE AND LEAVE A FOSSE BETWEEN THEM AND THE HIGHER GRANITE.
Tho ThE
RIDGE IS DEEPLY CUT BY SEVERAL NARROW NOTCHES (THE EASTERNMOST BEING ESPECIALLY NARROW) THE WISCON-
SIN WATERS MUST HAVE OVERRUN THE VERY TOP IN LARGE PART AND THESE BARS THEREFORE RECORD IMPINGEMENT
OF THE CURRENT AGAINST THE SUB-FLUVIAL BARRIER, AND THE PRODUCTION OF AN EDDY AT THE BASE.
A GLIMPSE ONLY WAS POSSIBLE FROM THE DRiVER's SEAT OF THE CAR, BUT IT SEEMED THAT THERE WERE
HILLS OF THE SILT DEPOSIT LYING BETWEEN THE GRANITE RIDGE AND THE GRAVEL BAR.
IF THIS BE SO,
IT HAS CONSIDERABLE SIGNIFICANCE IN DATING THE SLAT SILT.
THE UNDERCUT #POÉ SIDES OF A POTHOLE 40 FEET ACROSS AND PERHAPS 10 FEET IN MAX. PRESENT
DEPTH - LOCATED RIGHT ON THE BRINK OF CASTLE LAKE FALLS, IS SMOOTH AND WORN.
ThE OnLY KnOWN
EXAMPLE OF THESE POTHOLES WHICH STILL CARRIES A PART OF ITS ORIGINAL WORN SURFACE.
MOSES COULEE
JULY 26 1925
THE COULEE WaS CROSSED ON THE SUNSET HIGHWAY.
ON THE WEST SIDE, THIS HIWAY CLIMBS ON THE
GREAT WASTE DEPOSIT WHICH PUZZLED ME IN 1922.
NO ERRATIC MATERIAL WAS FOND IN IT THEN (NOR
THIS TIME)
ONE-HALF TALUS STANDS ON THE CLIFF BACK OF IT.
IT IS SOMETHING LIKE 200 FT.
ABOVE THE VALLEY FLOOR. ITS FORM, AS THEN SEEN, RESEMBLED A BAR BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE THEN TO
COSSODER IT AN ALLUVIAL FAN FROM THE BIG GULLY TO THE WEST.
THIS YEAR'S TRAVERSE SHOW THAT THE MAXWe/%/ MOUTH OF THE BIG GULLY TO THE WEST ISCOMPLETELY
BLOCKED BY IT, DAMMED BY IT, A LARGE UNDRAINED BASIN 40 FEET OR MORE IN DEPTH EXISTING BETWEEN IT
AND THE GULLY WALLS.
THE BACK SLOPE FROM THE DEPOSIT TOWARD THE BASIN IS ROUNDED IN PROFILE
EXACTLY AS ARE THE SCABLAND BARS.
THE DEPOSIT IS UNDOUBTEDLY A BAR.
IT HEIGHT AND LENGTH INDICATE IT TO BE A SPOKANE BAR FOR
IT IS HIGH ABOVE GHE WISC. VALLEY TRAIN.
IF NO ERROR HAS BEEN MADE IN THE INTERPRETATION WHICH
CALLS FOR LARGE EMPORATION AND LITTLE MELTING OF THE WISC. OKANOGAN LOBE, THEN THE BAR MUST BE
SPOKANE.
BUT IF SPOKANE, THE TALUS CRITERION FALLS DOWN FOR THERE ARE NO REAGONS WHY THIS BLUFF OF
HORIZONTAL FLOWS SHOULD NOT DEVELOP A 3/4 TALUS.
THE ADJUSTMENT OF FEATURES AT THIS LOCALITY
MUST WAIT MORE DETAILED AND MORE CAREFUL STUDY.
IT IS A CHALLENGE THAT MUST BE ANSWERED!
WENATCHEE TO CHELAN
JULY 28
LIGHT-COLORED SILT WITH VARVES, INTERBEDDED WITH DARKER SAND,
AND COMTAINING BLORS AND COBBLES AND PEBBLES, OCCUR AT SEVERAL PLACES ALONG THE HIWAY BETWEEN THESE
TWO POINTS.
ESPECIALLY WElL SHOWN NORTH OF KnaPP COULEE.
THEY HAVE BEEN DEFORMED COBSIDERABLY
BY SLIDING ON THE STEEP ROCK SLOPES OF CHELAN VALLEY.

SAME LEVEL AS THE BIG VERRACE ACROSS THE RIVER HERE; APPROXIMATELY 1000 FT. A. T.

OKANOGAN TO CONCONULLY TO LOOMIS TO TONASKET TO OMAK
TOPOGRAPHY ON OKANOGAN, CHOPAKA AND OSOYOOS SHEETS.
TWO PROMINENT N$S VALLEYS HERE, THE
TOATS COULEE AND PALMER LAKE VALLEY, AND THE OKANOGAN VALLEY.
ThE FORMER IS THE DEEPER AND
NARROWER THO IT CARRIES ONLY AN INCONSIDERABLE STREAM/ (SINLAHEKIN CREEK)
THIS STREAM FLOWS N.
TO JOIN THE SIMILKAMEEN WHICH HAS A VERY GORGE LIKE VALLEY ACROSS FROM THE WESTERN TO THE EASTERN
VALLEY.
AT THE SOUTH END OF TOATS COULEE IS CONCONULLY LAKE VALLEY, VERY NARROW, VERY STEEP-
SIDED, VERY DEEP.
ITS FLOOR IS ABOUT 500 FEET ABOVE FISH LAKE AT THE HEAD OF TOATS COULEE.
RISH LAKE ITSELF DRAINS TO 97 OX CREEK, AND NOT TO TOATS COULEE, THO THE COULEE TO THE NORTH IS
BROADLY OPEN EXCEPT FOR MORAINIC MATERIAL ON THE BOTTOM.
NOR DOES CONCONULLY DRAIN NORTHWARD.
ITS DISCHARGE. IS SOUTHWARD INTO SALMON CREEK.
THE DISCHARGE OF CONCONULLY LAKE PASSES A BROAD, SOUTHEASTWARD-TRENDING VALLEY ON ITS LEFT
GRAVEYARD FLAT- A GRAVEL FILL, WHOSE ALTITIDE IS 2300, TO ENTER A NARROW GORGE CUT ACROSS AN
EASTERN SPUR OF PEACOCK MN.
THE ORIGINAL ALT. ACROSS THIS SPUR COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN LESS
THAN 3100 (ORIGINAL=BEFORE THE NARROW NOTCH WAS CUT)
JUST EAST OF THIS GORGE OF SaLmon
IT LEADS DUF OF GRAVEM ARE FLAT NOR THE ORA NOTE + 0 OT 604 85 8 6 LP 1 5 0 LAKE BASE A 2400 O+
CREEK IN THE SPUR IS A DEFINITE NORTH SOUTH NOTCH CONTAINING
CREEK VALLEY TO THE SOUTHEAST.
THESE PECULIER RELATIONS ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF MOST OF THE DRAINAGE WAYS AND VALLEYS OF THE
EASTERN HALF OF THE CHOPAKA QUAD.
AN EXAMINATION OF THE MAP SHOWS THE FEATURES BETTER THAN A
WRITTEN DESCRIPTION.
THAT THEY ARE NOT DUE TO NORMAL STREAM EROSION IS PERFECTLY CLEAR.
THAT THEY ARE GLACIAL DERANGEMENTS IS OBVIOUS WHEN THE EXTENSIVE IRREGULAR TILL DEPOSITS OF THE
VALLEYS AND HILLSIDES AND EVEN MOUNTAIN SLOPES ARE CONSIDERED.
BUT THEY ARE NOT DUE TO BLOCK-
ING OF THE OLD VALLEYS BY DRIFT FOR THE DRIFT FILLINGS IN MANY CASES ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THE ROCK
HILLS AND SPURS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO SHARPLY TRENCHED.
TO CAUSE THE DIVERSIONS REQUIRES THE
PRESENCE OF GLACIAL ICE.
AND GLACIAL ICE OF GREAGER EXTENT AND OF GREATER DURABILITY THAN
REMNANTS OF A WASTING GLACIER OR ICE SHEET WOLD PROVIDE.
IT SEEMS THAT STREAMS FLOWING FROM
THE EDGE OF THE ICE WOULD BE UTTERLY UNABLE TO CAUSE THE DIVERSIONS AND THAT THE DRAINAGE MUST
HAVE BEEN SUBGLACIAL.
AND OF GREAT VOLUME AND IMMENSE EROSIVE ABILITY.
IT SEEMS THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER
ENORMOUS HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE 7 AND THAT IT MUST HAVE COME FROM SUBGLACIAL MELTING.
THIS IDEA,
OF COURSE, SPRINGS FROM THE FAVORED HYPOTHESIS SUBGLACIAL VULCANISM TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SCABBAND
FLOOD AND WOULD REQUIRE THAT THESE GREAT NARROW VALLEYS WHICH OUT ACROSS PRECORD1VIDES AND HILLS
BE OF SPOKANE ORIGIN, NOT WISCONSIN.
WISCONS IN MELTING, BY THIS EXPLANATION, SIMPLY CLEANED
THEM OR KEPT THEM CLEAN FROM WISCONSIN DRIFT, THE ONLY DRIFT RECOGNIZED IN THE REGION
The GREAT TERRACE DEPOSITS OF THE OKANOGAN VALLEY AND ITS FRIBUTARIES, AT LEAST FROM THE TOWN
OF OKANOGAN NORTH, DO NOT SEEM TO BE REMNANTS OF COMPLETE VALLEY FILLS.
NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE
EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT THEY WERBUILT ALONG HE EDGES OF WANING TONGUES OF COE LEFT AS THE WISC.
ICESHEET WASTED OFF THE HIGHER LANDS.
NEGATIVE EIDENCE EXISTS IN THE FACT THAT THE TERRACES
ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER IN ALTITUDE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE SAME VAULEY.
THERE ARE


-> SOME NOTEWORTHY CASES WHERE ONEVALLEY WALL HAS A
SET CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE SET ON THE OPPOSITE SIBE.
ALSO IN THE FACT THAT MANY TERRACES
MARGIN CLOSED DEPRESSION VALLEYS, IN WHICH THERE HAS BEEN NO EROSION, BUT RATHER DEPOSITION, SINCE
THE ICE MELTED AWAY.
It IS NOT THAT KETTLE HOLES EXIST IN THE TERRACES BUT THAT MOST OF A
VALLEY, LIKE WAGONROAD COULEE AND BIG GOOSE LAKE, IS A DEPRESSION AND THE TERRACES OCCUR BUT
SMALL PART OF THE WHOEE ROCK VALLEY.
POSITIVE EVIDENCE IS SEEN IN THE AMOUNT OF TILL IN THES TERRACES.
E. OF OKANOGAN TOWN ALL
BUT THE LOWEST ARE, OF TILL.
ALSO IN THE IRREGULAR SCARPS OF SOME WHICH ARE TAKEN TO BE ICE-
CONTACT SLOPES.
AGSO THE KETTLES AND KNOBS AND GERERAL MORAINIC ASPECT OF MANY.
ALSO IN THE
FACT THAT YPICAL KNOB-AND-KETTLE TOPOGRAPHY EXISTS IN THE VALLEYS BELOW THE LEVEL OF IMMEDIATELY
ADJACENT TERRACES.
THIS REQUIRES THE PRESENCE OF @CE OVER THE K-AND--K WHEN THE FLAT-TOPT TERRACE
WAS BUILT.
THEY ARE CONTEMPORANEOUS, AND THE TERRACES ARE REALLY REMARKABLY SMOOTH KAME
TERRACES.
WAGONROAD COULEE IS THE PREGLACIAL COURSE OF OKANOGAN RIVER.
THE POST-GLACIAL COURSE LIES
EAST OF WR COULEE.
SINCE WR COULEE FLOOR, AS AGGRADED AT PRESENT, IS ABOUT 1000 AT AND THE HILL
TOP BETWEEN IT AND THE PRESENT COURSE IS 500 TO $000 FEET HIGHER, IT SEEMS THAT THIS DIVERSION,
LIKE CONCONULLY LAKE, HESS LAKE VALLEY, BROWN AND GREEN LAGES VALLEY, ETC., MUST HAVE BEEN MADE
UNDER THE ICE.

BOOT MT. STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT VALLEY IN WHICH THESE TWO LAKES LIE. NOWHERE
WERE PRECIPITOUS SLOPES, LIKE THOSEOF CONCONULLY AND ITS CLASS.
THE VALLEY APPARENTLY IS NOT
OF THE SAME GENUS, BUT ITS CAUSE IS DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF.
THERE IS BUT ONE STEEP-WALLED VALLEY OF THE CONCONULLY GENUS ALOG THE OKANOGAN-NESPELEM-GOOSE
LAKE ROAD.
THaT IS NEAR THE HEAD OF THE DESCENT 10 NESPELEM.
THE ABSENCE OF A TOPOGR. MAP
AND LACK BF ADEQUATE FIELD EXAMINATION LEAVES THE MATTER IN DOUBT BUT THE VALLEY WAS CERTAINLY
FORMED UNDER GLACIAL DRAINAGE CORDITIONS.
NESPELEM FLAT HELD UP TO. ITS ALTITUDE OF 800 OR 830 ABOVE THE COLUMBIA BECAUSE THE NESPELEM
RIVER AS ENCOUNTERED A SHOULDER OF A PREGLACIAL GRANITE HILL AT ITS MOUTH.

AGROSS THE COLUMBIA
HOWEVER, ARE OOME FRESHLY CUT SCARPS WHICH SHOW PALE SILTS WHICH RESEMBLE THE WENATCHE, CHELAN AND
GRAND COULEE VARVE COLArS.
IT IS CERTAINLY CURIOUS THAT THIS WIDE TRACT BETWEEN OKANOGAN AND NESPELEM RIVERS CARRIES
NO SUCH DRAINAGE MODIFICATIONS AS THOSE BETWEEN OKANOGAN AND TOATS VALLEYS.
IT MAY BE DUE TO THE
PREGLACIAL ALLEYS OF OkANOGAN AND TOATS INVITING SHE SUPPOSED SUBGLACIAL DRAINAGE AND THE HIGH
MTS. NORTH OF THIS TRAVERSE OF TODAY PREMENTING SUCH DRAINAGE ACROSS THEM, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE
BUREED IN THE ICE.
NESPELEM VALLEY JUST NORTH OF THE TOWN CONTAINS A FRONTAL MORAINE OF THE TONGUE WHICH OCCUPIED
IT DURING THE LATEST STAGES OF THE WISCONSIN GLACIATION IT IS NOT STRIRINGLY HUMMOCKY BUT IT
CONSTITUTES A BELT OF DRIFT 50 FEET OR MORE THICK, ACROSS WHICH THE STREAM HAS CUT A NARROW VALLEY.

ANOTHER POINT OF IMPORTANCE IS THAT THE OKANOGAN VALLEY IN WASHINGTON CONTAINS BUT LITTLE OF
THE WHITE SILTS.
MOST OF IT IS GRAVEL.
THIS IS BECAUSE THERE WAS A GRADIENT HERE WHILE ALONG
THE LENGTH OF THE LAKE-FILLED VALLEY, THERE WAS LITTLE, IF ANY, GRADIENT, AND THE MARGINAL WATERS
AMU SEVERAL GOOD ICE-CONTACT SLOPES OF GRAVEL TERRACES IN OSOMOOS VALLEY.

LAKE VALLEY IS IN ONE OF THE GREAT LONG NOTCHES ACROSS A MANOR DIVIDE AND THE WATERS ENTERING HERE

THE QUESTION OF THE SOURCE OF THE GRAVEL IN THE TERRACES IS A BIT PUZZLING. IT DOES NOT
SEEM PROBABLE THAT THE MELTING OF THE WANING STAGNANT TONGUES COULD YIELD ALL THEDEBRIS, YET A
COMMON FEATURE IS THE GENTLE SLOPE OF A TERRACE SURFACE FROM THE WALLEYWARD SCARP TOWARD THE AD-
MORA INIC

NOT LIKELY THAT MUCH OF THE DRIFT WHICH WAS IN THE ICE DIRECTLY ABOVE, THE ICE WHICH MELTED OFF TO

ICE (THE TONGUE) CONTAINED ORIGINALLY, PLUS ALL OR NEARLY ALL THAT THE SUPERJACENT ICE CONTAINED?
SECTIONS THRUOUT THE REGION SHOW ALMOST NO SYSTEM OR ORDER IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF TILL, GRAVEL
AND VARVE SILT IN THE TERRACES. ON TILL ABOVE SILT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN, BUT EVERY OTHER COMBINATION
OF THE THREE HAS BEEN.
IN GENERAL, THE LOWEST TERRACES AREL LIKELY TO BE OF SILT, IF SILT IS TO
PRESENT IN THE VALLEY, OR OF GRAVEL IF NO SILT EXISTS AT THAT PLACE. AND UPPER TERRACES ARE MORE
LIKELY TO BE OF TILL THO THEY MAY HAVE A PLANE GRAVELLY TERRACE TOP. IS IT NOT LIKELY THAT MOST

CLARKS FORK VALLEY BETWEEN Z CANYON AND NEWPORT.
TO AUG.. 18 1925
THE PREGLACIAL VALLEY HERE HAD ITS HEAD IN THE VICINITY OF Z CANYON, 10 MI. BY ROAD NORTH OF
METALINE FALLS. THIS VALLEY DRAINED EASTWARD FROM NEWPORT ACROSS THE RANGE TO THE PEND.
OREILLE LAKE VALLEY OR TO THE HOODOO VALLY, THENCE TO THE PREGLACIAL COLUMBIA IN THE SPOKANE VALLEY.
THE EVIDENCE FOR THE DIVIDE CONSISTS IN THE GENERAL HIGH ALTITUDE OF THE VICINITY AND THE REMARKA-
BLE CANYON CUT IN ROCK. THE MS OF THIS REGIOM ARE MORE LOFTY THAN ANY OTHERS ALOG THE ENTIRE
DISTANCE UP FROM NEWPORT-ROM AND THEY COME CLOSER TOGETHER. THE SITE IS ESSENTIALLY THAT OF A r
PREGLACIAL LOW SADDLE. /A ROCK HILLS, NOW IN PART BURIED IN WISCONS IN DRIFT, RISE AS MUCH AS 1000
REET ABOVE THE RIVER. THE SITE OF THE Z HAS AN ALTITUDE OF ABOIT 2100 ATAT THE BRINK OF THE 39 AGA
CANYON WHERE THE STREAM FIRST BEGAN TO TRENCH. THE DRIFT FILL TRAVERSED BY THE ROAD ON THE WEST
SIDE OF THE RIVER RISES TO 2600. THERE IS NO POBSIBILITY OF USING THE IDEA OF SUPERPOSITION
OF THE STREAM ON A ROCK SHOULDER OF A FORMER THRU VALLEY HERE, WHICH BY HYPOTHEISIS IS NOW BURIED
IN DRIFT. THERE IS NO MAIN VALLEY HERE AND THERE NEVER HAS BBEN IN W

CAUSED ITS TRANSFER TO THE PRESENT COURSE ARE UNKNOWN. THE NORTHPORT-TO-COME- VALLEY WAS ORIG
INALLY A RELATIVELY SHORT SOUTH-FLOWING GRIBUTARY. U ABOUT NORTHPORT AND BOUNDARY, THE COLUMBIA

THE SPOKANE HISTORY OF (LARKS FORK VALLEY NORTH OF NEWPORT IS, POORLY RECORDED.

AND IF NOTCHES BE A CRITERION OF SUBGLACIAL STREAMS, CLARKS FORK VALLEY CARRIED SUCH STREAMS
THE REAL FEATURE ON WHICH THE ARGUMENT IS BASED IS A GROUP OF THREE NOTCHES CUT ACROSS TWO SPURS Projecting
into
FROM THE EAST SIDE OPTHE VALLEY ABOUT THREE MILES NORTH OF NEWPORT. *
THESE ARE GASHES WHOLLY

OUT OF HARMONY WITH ANY OTHER TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES IN THE REGION. THEY ARE VERY NARROW AND
STEEP-SIDED AND TREY CROSS. THE SPURS PRETTY WELL OUT. TOWARD THEIR VALLEYWARD TERMIMi.

THE LARGEST AND MOST PROMINENT OF THESE NOTCHES IS VISIBLE FROM NEWPORT. ITS BOTTOM IS ABOUT
THE LEVEL OF THE HIGHEST DRIFT. TERRACE HERE BUT THIS IS A COINCIDENCE/ ONLY.
WISC. ICE APPARENT-
LY DID NOT REACH ANY OF THEM, SO THEY MUST BE OF SPOKANE AGE.


THE WISCONSIN HISTORY OF CLARKS FORK VALLEY NORTH OF NEWPORT IS PECULIAR TO THIS
VALLEY. " THE WiSC TM APPARENTLY LIES A FEW MILES NORTH OF NEWPORT... IT IS RECORDED BY MORAINE
DAMS FOR MARSHALL LAKE (ALT OF DAM HT) AND BEAD LAKE (ALT OF DAM 2900. LAKE 2800), AND BY INFER-
ENCE THE OTHER TWO OR THREE SMALLER LAKES IN THIS REGION ARE OF THE SAME ORIGIN. GRAVEL TERRACES
OF LIMITED EXTENT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MORAINE _HEIR ALTITUDES VARY. As A MORAINE, THIS
EASTERN PART IS POORLY EXPRESSED.
AND THERE IS NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY. ON THE
WEST SIDE, 7 MILES OR SO NORTH OF NEWPORT BY ROAD, IS A LINE OF HILLS ALONG THE BASE OF THE MT.
WALL; MORAINIG IN ASPECT, PROPERLY PLACED FOR MORAINE AND INEXPLICABLE UNLESS THEY ARE MORAINE. 14T

ARE ALSO OF THE SAME AGE- NAMELY, LATE WISCONSIN.

VALLEYS OF THIS : FEGION.
BUT LAKE SILTS OF THE COLUMB IA VAILEY BETWEEN BOUNDARY LINE AND SPOKANE RIVER, IN COLVILLE
VALLEY, IN CLARKS FORK VALLEY NORTH OF NEWPORT, ABOUT BONERS FERRY, ETC, WERE AS UNQUESTIONABLY


Sue
DEPOSITED IN LAKES WHICH FILLED THE ENTIRE VALLEYS, AT LEAST FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
THESE LAKES
ALL REQUIRE A DAMN EVERY CASE THE VALLEYS OPEN TO THE SOUTH.
FOR COLVILLE VALLEY, THE MORAINE
AND OUTWASH SOUTH OF SPRINGDALE CONSTITUTE A DAM, AT LEAST UNTIL THE CCE HAD RETREATED NORTH OF
COLVILLE.
FOR COLUMBIA VALLEY NORTH OF SPOKANE RIVER JCT., THE SPOKANE VALLEY TRAIN MUST HAVE A
BEEN THE DAM. FOR CLARKS FORK, PENDOREDLE LAKE AND BONNERS FERRY, ALL THESE VALLEYS BEING OPEN
INTO ONE ANOTHER BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE SILTS, THE RATHORUM PRAIRIE AND LITTLE SPOKANE VT MUST
HAVE BEEN THE DAM. SILTS THEN WERE DEPOSITED IN THE DEPRESSIONS WHERE THE CCE LAY WHEN THE SN
MORAINES AND VTS WERE DEPOSITED, AND RETREAT FROM THESE DEPRESSIONS MUST HAVE BEEN VERY RAPID AH
TO AVOID THEIR FILLING WITH GRAVEL, OR THE SUPPLY OF GRAVEL MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS DURING RETREAT
ALONG THESE STRETCHES.
