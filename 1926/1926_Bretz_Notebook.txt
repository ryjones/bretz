RED ROCK PASS. IDAHO MO JULY 1 1926
MIN
. IN A TOPOGRAPHIC SETTING OF WASTE COVERED MOUNTAIN SLOPES AND WASTE-AND-SEDIMENT-FILLED INTER-
MONTANE VALLEY, THERE STANDS A GROUP OF ROCK HOLLS WITH LESS PROMINENT AND SOME WITH ALMOST
VERTICAL CLIFFS. A NEITHER UP NOR DOWN THE VALLEY , AND NOT ON EITHER SLOPE, ARE THERE ANY ROCK
LEDGES IN VIEW, BUT THESE CLIFFED HILLS RISE 300 PET AND MORE ABOVE THE OLD CHANNEL FLOOR.
SUCH IS THE CONTRAST AT RED ROCK PASS.
FROM LOGAN NORTHWARD ALMOST TO POCATELLO, THIS
GROUP OF CLIFFS AND KNOBS OR ROCK IS ALMOST THE ONLY EXPOSURE OF iNDURATED ROCK. @ TeaM 3HT 88
THE LOCATION IS AT AND FOR A MILE NORTH OF SWAN LAKE.
RED ROCK BLUFF IS ONE OF THE GROUP.
IT IS ESSENTIALLY ON THE DIVIDE WHERE BONNEVILLE'S WATERS SPILLED NORTHWARD AND.ACCORDING TO GIL-
BERT, CUT DOWN 375 FEET IN ALLUVIUM IN ABOUT 25 YEARS. DOES GILBERT DESCRIBE THE ROCK KNOBS
AND HILLS? HE MUST HAVEHAD AN EXPLANATION FOR THEM, IF HE HELD THAT THE CUTTING WAS IN ALLUVIUM.
AND AN EXPLANATION IS NOT EASY!
IT IS TRUE THAT RED ROCK BLUFF, ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE COL, SEEMS TO BE PARTLY BURIED IN
WASTE FROM THE WASATCH RANGE TO THE WEST.
IT IS TRUE THAT THE SCARPS OF THE OLD CHANNEL ALONG
THE WEST SIDE, BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ROCK BLUFF, ARE IN ALLUVIAL WASTE.
IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT THESE KNOBS ARE ERODED REMNANTS OF ROCK HILLS WHICH WERE EROSIONALKAJ
FORMS BEFORE THE WASTED ACCUMULATED IN PRE-BONNEVILE TIME. IT DOES NOT SEEM PROBABLE THAT THERE
WAS A COMPLETE RIDGE OF ROCK OR BARRIER OF ROCK ACROSS CACHE VALLEY HERE WHEN BONNEVILLE TOPPED
THE CREST AND SPILLED OVER TO THE SNAKE. IT HARDLY SEEMS LIKELY, FROM THE EVIDENCE SEEN FROM THE
-OP OF RED ROCK BLUFF, THAT BONNEVILLE WATERS EXCAVATED THE PASS AT THIS PLACE ENTIRELY IN ROCK. 1%.%
BUT, WHETHER OR NOT THE WHOLE CHANNEL HERE WAS ERODED IN ROOK, IT IS OLEAR THAT GREAT EROS-Q1
ION OF ROCK OCCURRED.
YA THESE BEETLINg CLiFFS ARE SO OUT OF HARMONY WITH EVERYTHINg ELSE IN THE
WHOLE REGION THAT THEY MUST BE DUE TO THE RIVER WHICH SPILLED OVER TO THE SNAKE.
THE ROCK, AT LEST IN RED ROCK BLUFF, IS A VOLCANIC FLOW AND BRECCIA.

THE PECULIAR ORAINAGE PATTERN OF THE SNAKE, SALMON, CLEARWATER GROUP MAY BE THE RESULT OF - J
FOLDING OF THE BASALT IN LARGE PART.
BUT IF THIS BE TRUE, THE SALMON CANNOT BE HELD To › cUT
AGROSS THE ANTICLINE BETWEEN WHITE BIRD AND GRANGEVILLE. PERHAPS IT DOESNT. THE FOLD'S AXIAL
CREST CERTAINLY IS LOWER WESTWARD FROM THE HIGHWAY CROSSING TO THE SAMMON CANYON.

BUT ANOTHER, DIFFICULTY LIES IN THE E- ORIENTATION OF THIS FOLD AND THE LONG N-S SNAKE-SALMON
DiVIDE WHICH, BY THE ABOVE HYBOTHESIS, SHOULD BE A FOLD IN THE BASALT. OBVIOUSLY, THE REGION
NEEDS MORE STUDY. vas
THE PLATEAU FROM GRANGEVILLE TO LEWISTON LIES IN TWO GREAT LEVELS OR VERY GENTLE SLOPES, ONE
FROM GRANGEVILLE TO WINCHESTER AT AN ALTITUDE NOR FAR FROM 3000 FEET ABID ONE FROM CUL DE SAC TO
THE SNAKE AND THE CLEARWATER, WEST AND NORTH RESPECTIVELY, AT AN ALTITUDE NOR FAR FROM 1700, PERHAPS
AS HIGH AS 2000 NEAR THE UPPER EDGE. A STEEP SLOPE SEPARATES THEM, A MONOCLINAL SLOPE ALMOST 700
AS STEEP AS THAT NORTH OF LEWiSTON AND OnLY a LITTLE LESS HIGH.
NO REVETMENT SPURS HOWEVER WERE
SEEN, WHILE THEY ARE VERY CONSPICUOUS IN THE LEWISTON MONOCLINE.
THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EROSION BY THE SNAKE AND CLEARWATER NEAR THEIR JCT IS TO BE MEASURED BROM
THIS 1700 FBOT PLATEAU AND AMTS TO ABOUT 1000 FT. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO MONOCLINAL DIP FROM THE
1700 PLATEAU DOWN TO OR TOWARD THE SNAKE OR CLEARWATER.
WHAT IS THE ORIENTATION OF THIS MONOCLINE FROM 3000 TO 1700 LEVEL?
THE PLATEAU ABOUT GRAMGEVILLE, NOTABLY BETWEEN COTTONWOOD AND FERDINAND AND WESTWARD, IS TALE
INTERRUPTED BY GRANITE HILLS WHICH, THO LARGELY MANTLED BY WASTE, ARE KNOBBY AND IRREGULAR IN SIM
EXPRESSION AND EASILY DIFFERENTIATED FROM BASALT UPLIFTS EVEN THO ARRANGED, OR APPARENTLY ARRANGED, O

AB-
SENCE OF GRAVEL MEANS FAILURE OF FLOOD TO OCCUR IN THE CLEARWATER VALLEY.
THEN IF THE FLOOD WAs
OF CLIMATIC CAUSATION, THE VALLEY GLACIERS OF THE CLEARWATER DRAINAGE MUST HABE BEEN TOO SMALL TO
HAVE PRODUCED ANY RECORDABLE EFFECT.
THE CLEARWATER VALLEY SHOWS MOST ADMIRABLY THE TWO CYCLES OF VALLEY DEVELOPMENT.

BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY. THERE IS A VERTICAL RANGE IN ALTITUDE OF ITS REMNANTS THAT MAY AMOUNT TO

THE CONEPTION NOW ADVOCATED: IS THAT THE TWO. OYOLES ARE RECORDED ONLY BY EROSIONAL FORMS, AND
THAT THE AGGRADATIONAL EPISODE OF THE OLD GRAVEL OCCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE CUTTING OF THE INNER

ABOUT LEWISTON, CLARKSOON AND ASOTIN WERE ALSO COVERED. THOSE FARTHER UP THE CLEARWATER WERE

THE SPOKAnE FLOOD WHICH SWEPT OVER THE PALOYSE-SNaKE DIVIDE (HOOPERS TO PERRY) RAN UP INTO
THE LOWER /PART OF A LARGE TRIB, FM THE SOUTH (PROBABLY FIELDS GULCH OF WALLAWALLA MAP) AND
APPARENTLY THEN RAN WESTWARD OVER THE WEST WALL BETWEEN THIS TRIB VALLEY AND THE SNAKE.
THE
SCOURING OF BASALT CLIFFS IS VERY MÜRKED FOR MORE THAN A MILE BACK FROM THE SNAKE.

The
RATHER CAPACIOUS TRIB, VALLEY HAS HUGE GRAVEL DEPOSITS IN IT, LYING TO THE LEE (sOUTH) OF THE BIt
BASALT EMINENCES, BEING HIGHEST AGAINST THEM AND SLOPING SOUTHWARD AWAY FROM THE SNAKE.
THESE PROBABLY ARE 1000 FT AT AND THE SCOURED BASALT FULLY 100 FT HIGHER.

ALL SCABLAND.
EVEN The LaRGe TRACT OF PALOUSe HILLs NORTH OF THE PALOUSE AND BETWEEN COW CREEK

THE SCABBY LEDGES OF THE UPPER WALLS OF THE SNAKE AND BACK
FROM THE EDGES ArE cOnsPicUOUS.
THERe APPEARS TO BE A GROUP OF LOESSIAL HILLS WEST OF THE

PALOUSE CANYON, ALMOST ON THE BRINK OF THE SNAKE, WHICH HAVE BEEN CUT THRU IN SEVERAL PLACES BY
THE SPREADING FLOOD.
PROBA LY THIS IS ON MY MAP.
On AGROPLANE VIEW ALONE WOULD BE BETTER I
THAN THIS. O THE ENSEMBLE IS CONVINCING, ABSOLUTELY CONVINCING.
Yes: it showed the giant ripples!
THE TERRACE NORTH OF GRANGE CITY JCT HAS EXCELLENT LONG FORESETS, AS SEEN FROM THE SOUTH SIDE
OF THE RIVER.
BUT THESE ARE NOT CONTINUOUS.
ThErE ARE PLACES WHERE THE GRAVEL BEDDING IS
ONLY SLIGHTLY INCLINED AND PLACES WHERE LOW PLACES LEFT IN THE ACCUMULATING GRAVEL WERE FILLED
SEVERAL FEET DEEP WITH PALE BROWN SILT.

OCCURRED As RAPIDLY AS THE GRAVEL COULD HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED.

NO MEASUREMENTS ON BIPPING FLOWS CAN BE

BUT EROSION IS WHOLLY INADEQUATE TO EXFAIN THESE BROAD, BENTLY

AND OF COURSE THE LEWISTON MONOCLINE AND MANY OTHER FOLDS SHOW THEIR NATURE
TO BE DIASTROPHIC.
THE DRAINAGE PATTERN IN LARGE PART IS DETERMINED BY THE STRUCTURE THO SUCH THINGS AS THE SNAKES
ABRUPT ENTRANCE INTO THE UPLiFTED SIDE OF THE MONOCLINE MUST BE CONSIDERED AS ANTECECENT. TO
THE DISTRIBUTION OF LOESSIAL HILLS ON THE COLUMBIA PLATEAU.
AppArEnTLY ALL GRADATIONS EXIST BETWEEN A BASALT PLATEAU ALMOST PLANE, STREAM-WAYS A MILE OR
in themselves
SO APART/AND THE MERE BEGINNINGS OF VALLEYS/( ANATONE REGION), AND A BASALT PLATEAU SO DISSECTED
THAT ALMOST NO PLANE SURFACES REMAIN ON THE UPLANDS.
AND NO ADEQUATE EXPLANATION FOR THE
DIFFERENCES HAS BEEN FOUND.
RAINFALL TODAY, ALTITUDE, DISTANCE FROM MASTER STREAM, DEPTH OF
MASTER GORGE, CHARACTER OF THE FORMATION-
• ALL SEEM TO BE THE SAME.
RECENCY OF UPLIFT IN THE
UNDISSECTED TRACTS CANNOT BE ARGUED BECAUSE THE ANATONE DRAINAGE FLOWS TO THE MORE DISSECTED AREAS
AND HAS DONE SO SINCE THE EROSIONAL HISTORY BEGAN.
ApPARENTLY ALL GRADATIONS EXIST BETWEEN A PLATEAU WITH WERY THIN SOIL, A PLATEAU WITH VT$ A
THICK MANTLE OF FINE-TEXTURED SOIL, AND A PLATEAU WITH ITS FINE SOIL HEAPED UP IN A TUMULTUOUSLY
BILLOWY TOPOGRAPHY THAT HAS FEW PARALLELS, EiTHER IN THE FIELD OR ON THE MAP.

TO THIS ITEM SHOULD BE ADDED ANOTHER VERY PREVALENT BEATURE OF THE N, NE, NNE HILLS SLOPES;
IT IS THEIR AMPHITHEATER LIKE SHAPE.
MANY HILLS SEEM ALMOST LIKE BARCHAN DUNES, WITH TWO LONG
SPURS AND AN ENCLOSED HOLLOW WHICH MAY HAVE SLOPES OF 30° OR MORE AND GENERALLY IS BROAD AND
SHALLOW AT THE TOP AND NARROW AND DEEP AT THE BOTTOM. IN VAIN WERE SUCH FEATURES SOUGHT ON THE AS
SOUTHERN SLOPES. THEY ARE NOT PRESENT. JAy S400 SHTIATIN DaTAJaRaDO 33 OF TAJ3 AXESUS SI
NOW THIS FEATURE ALONE SUGGESTS WIND WORK. WHEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WITH THE SILTY H
LOESS IAL CHARACTER OF THE MATERIAL, THE FACT THAT THE HILLS ARE ALMOST WHOLLY OF LOESS TO THEIR
BASES, TI# AND THE STRIKING ELONGATION IN PARALELISM, THE CASE BECOMES VERY STRONG.
VASTA
SUCH VALLEYS AS BADGER HOLLOW, FIELDS GULCH, WINNET CANYON, TOUCHET RIVER VALLEY, ETC..
WHICH ARE THE MASTER. DRAINAGE LINES AND ARE WELL DOWN IN BASALT, WERE HERE BEFORE THE DEVELOPMENT aH
OF THE LOESSIAL HILLS. THEIR COURSES WERE DETERMINED LARGELY BY THE WARPED SURFACES OF HE MANE
BASALT, AND LOESSIAL DEPOSITS HAVE NOT BEEN A)LLOWED TO ACCUMULATE IN THEM.
BUT EARLY IN THE
DEVELOOMENT OF THE DRAINAGE PATTERN, LOESS AND FINE SAND DRIVEN BY PREVAILING WINDS (DURING THE
DRIER PART OF THE YEAR AT ANY RATE). BEGAN TO LODGE IN THE AREA. ACCUMULATION WAS NOT SO RAPID
THAT DRAINAGE WAS INTERFERED WITH VERY SERIOUSLY. NO CLOSED DEPRESSIONS, SUCH AS THOSE AMONG
SAND DUNES. W DUST WHICH LODGED IN THE VALLEYS WAS SWEPT OUT BYTHE STREAMS BUT DUST WHICH LODGED
ON THE INTERFLUVES REMAINED. SINCE THE MINOR STREAM WAYS WERE NOT ETCHED INTO THE BASALT, THEIR
ORIENTATION WAS DEVELOPED DOING THE ACCUMULATION UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE GROWING HILLOCKS AND
THE SLOPE OF THE BASALT PLATEAU IN GENERAL. gAms оиа войом йодваяа, ади 90013
The LINEAR DIVIDES THEREFORE ARE THE DETERMINING FEATURES OF THE PATTERN AND THEY ARE, OR aaVT#
HAVE BEEN, GROWING ACTUALLY HIGHER. A PERHAPS THE SEPARATING LINEAR VALLEYS HAVE BEEN DEEPENED A
(WHERE BASALT LEDGES SCOW, THIS INFERENCE IS FAIR ENOUGH), PERHAPS HEY HAVE BEEN AGGRADED
SOMEWHAT AS THE HILLS HAVE GROWN. O18ORB MA 21 YAMASJO SIARRA SUONY SHT CA BABA
ONE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS INTERPRETATION IS THAT LINEAR DUNES (AND THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY SUCH)
ARE NOT COMPOSED OF SEPARATE DUNE HILLOCKS BUT HAVE FAIRLY UNIFORM SIDES AND CRESTS. - y
SAMPLES OF THE LOESS OF THIS TRACT SHOULD BE SECURED AND COMPARED WITH SAMPEES FROM THE JaMWANS
LOESSIAL TRACTS WHERE DENDRITIO PATTERN PREVAILS. A THE LOESS SHOULD BE COARSER IN THE LINEAR HT 50
# TRACTS WHICH BEAR HE PALOUSE HILLS OF LOESS GRADE WITNIN A FEW MILES TO TRACTS WHERE THE A JHADE
BASALT IS JUST UNDER THE GRASS ROOTS (BR NEARLY SO) AND THE PATTERN IS MUCH COARSER TEXTURED, WITH 8
RUNNING WATER OBVIOUSLY THE ONLY AGENT WHICH HAS MODIFIED THE DIASTROPHICALLY DETERMINED MAJOR AUTAL
FEATURES.

AS MARGIN IT AFTER IT WAS ABANDONED. AT AND IF THEY ARE OLDER, THE SNAKE AT PERRY HAS CUT FROM

IT RISES 25 FT FROM A BASIN ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE (BASIN NOW DRAINED BY A SMALL GULLY THRU THE BAR)
AND IT DESCENDS 45 FT TO THE ENERAL CHANNEL FLOOR ON THE SOUTH OR DOWNSTREAM SIDE. CHANNEL WALLS
ARE ALSO WELL MARKED HERE AND THE WHOLE AFFAIR CLEARLY IS AN EROSIONAL FEATURE OF THE FLOOD, TAN
MODIFIED AND ENLARGED FROM AN EARLIER DRAINAGE LINE THAT TOOK CARE ONLY OF IMMEDIATE RUNOFF.
A TRIB OF THIS PRE-SPOKANE DRAINAGE HERE WAS PARTIALLY BLOCKED BY THE GROWTH OF THE TRANS-
duiributorys

OF THE BAR, 10 FT. OF MORE IN DEPTH, JUST AS THE BASIN ABOVE THE BAR HAS BIVEN RISE TO A GULLY. 25
THE TRIB IS A VERY NARROW GULLY OR RAVINE ITSELF, CUT IN THE BASALT WEST OF THIS WALLULA GATEWAY, 2.40
SCABLANDS. 13 IT TAKES CARE OF PERHAPS A TENTH OF THE RUNOFF WHICH COMES FROM THE HIGHER WESTERN
SLOPE. 05/IT ENTERS WELL TOWARD THE UPPER END OF THE CHANNEL.)
THERE SHOULD THERBFORE BE SOME ex a
NATURAL PROPORTIONAL RELATIONS BETWEEN CHANNEL AND TRIBUTARY, IF THE CHANNEL IS LARGELY THE PRODUCT

ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT FEATURE OF THE CHANNELS AND SCABLAND FORMS ON TOP OF THE WESTERN CLIFFS

THe UPPER LIMIT TS MARKED BY A

THIS SEARP SHOWS THAT THERE IS A DEPTH HERE OF 20-30

BETWEEN THIS SECONDARY ROAD AND THE ROAD SOITH OUT OF WALLULA IS A BROAD SHELF

ThIs
WHOLE SHOULDER HAS BEEN STRIPPED OF ITS SOIL AND NOW BEARS ONLY BROKEN BASALT RUBBLE AND THIN

AnD 1100+ SEEMS TO HAVE
ESCAPED THE FLOOD ON THE EAST SIDE ON THE PROMINENT HILL 100 FT. HIGH ABOUT A MILE SW OF THE 1200
SHOULDER.
PERHAPS THE LOWER PLACES NOTED WERE SPARED BECAUSE OF SUFFICIENT GRADIENT IN THE RIVER
SURFACE ITSELF IN THE DISTANCE INVOLVED.
IT IS CLEAR FROM A SURVEY OF THE EAST SIDE BELOW 1150
THAT A TREMENDOUS TORRENT RIPPED UP THE PRE-SPOKANE VALLEY SLOPES HERE.
PERHAPS THE SITUATION
HERE WAs SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THAT AT KETTLE FALLS TODAY, WHERE THE COLUMBIA RIVER SURFACE DESCENDS
AMONG ITS ROCKY ISLANDS AND OVER SUBMERGED LEDGES WITH TORRENTIAL VELOCITY AND WITH NOTABLE
DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL OF THE WATER IN ANY ONE CROSS SECTION.
ONE SIDE CREAT STREAM IN SUCH A
SITUATIONMAY BE SEVERAL PEET HIGHER THAN THE OTHER, THE MIDDLE MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE SIDES,
AND THE SLOPE OF THE WATER SURFAGE- MAY BE STEEPER ON ONE PART THAN IN ANOTHER.
WHAT IS REQUIRED

AT THE TIME OF THE GREATEST PONDING AT THE GATEWAY, AND SUBSEQBENTLY DISSECTED AS THE GATEWAY WAS

A CONSTANT PUZZLE IN THE GABLE EMINENCES IS HOW WATERS IN THIS BROAD VALLEY, ALL OF WHICH HAD
TO PASS THRU THE NARROW GATEWAY, COULD HAVE HAD THE VELOCITY ADEOUATE TO PLUCK AND ERODE THESE

ISNT IT POSSIBLE THAT THE FAVORITE 500 FT LEVEL OF MANY OF THESE BARS IS A RELIC OF A PRE-
SPOKANE RIVER TERRACE, PERHAPS OUTWASH, PERHAPS CAUSED BY SUBSIDENSE, LIKE THE CENTRAL FERRY
TRACES ON THE SNAKE, AND THAT THE SPOKE FLOOD SIMPLY MODIFIED THIS EXISTING FILL, EXCAVATED

WHY WERENT THEY SWEPT OFF IF THE WATER AFTER CROSSING THEM ERODED THE WALLA WALLA CANYON? THE M
ONLY EXPLANATION SEEMS TO BE THAT CONFINEMENT IN W CANYON, CONFISEMENT ONLY OF THE BOTTOM OF THE

VICINITY OF SPOKANE
JULY 2011026 80394
THERE IS REAL SCABLAND; CLIFFED, MESAD, BUTTED, BASINED, ALONG THE MARGIN OF SPOKANE VALLEY
ON THE INDIAN AND EQUR MOUND PRAIRIE MARGINS.
IT IS A MILE OR SO IN WIDTH AND DOES NOT LIE ON
THE VALLEY SLOPES. IT IS PART OF THE PRAIRIE SURFACE.
21 RUT THIS IS ABOUT ALL.
THE BROAD
EXPANSE OF THE BASALT PLAIN HAS A FEW ROCK KNOBS HERE AND THERE, AS AT WOODS LAKE AND HORSESHOE
LAKE, BUT THESE ARE NOT QLIFFED AND LOOK MORE RUBBED BY ICE THAN PLUCKED BY STREAM ACTION.
COULD THIS CHANNELLED SCABLAND BE THE PRODUCT OF A SUBGLACIAL ESCAPE WHICH WAS GUIDED BY THE
SPOKAnE VALLEY BENEATH?
IT CONTINUES IN MORE OR LESS DEFINITE FASHION TOWARD OR TO THE MARSHALL
VALLEY WHERE A SUBGLACIAL DISCHARGE WAS POSTULATED.
REAL MORAINE, MOUNDED AND KETTLY, IN THE HEADS OF THE CHANNELS NORTH OF CHENEY AND AT MEDICAL
LAKE CHANNEL WEST OF THE MED. LAKE CHANNEL SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CLEANED OUT BY WATER FOR A MILE
OR TWO NORTH OF THE HEAD, BACK ON THE BASALT PLAIN, AS THO WATER CROSSED TO THE HEAD OF THE CHAN-
NEL LATE IN THE EPISODE AFTER THE ICE EDGE HAD RETREATED SOMEWHAT.
THE STRIKiNG THING IS THAT THESE WELL-MARKED CHANNELS, WITH SCARPS OUT IN THEIR GRANITE ON)
SLOPES AND SOME WITH SCARPS AROWD THE NORTH ENDS OF THE INTERCHANNEL HILLS, SHOULD CARRY MORAINE
ACROSS THEIR HEADS. FOR NO WATER COULD USE THESE CHANNELS AND SPARE THE MORAINES.
40 100
LOCAL RELIEF OF MORAINE IS ABOUT 25-30 FEET.
ThIcKnESS UNKnOWN.
ONE EXPLANATION IS THAT MORAINE IS YOUNGER THAN THE CHANNEL OCCUPANCY.
ANOTHER IS THAT
ALL THE WATER CAME OVER THE SURFACE OF THE ICE AnD THE FRONT HELD ITS OWN.
• THE LATTER EXPLAN-
ATION 15 DEFECTIVE IN THAT ESCAPING GLACIAL WATERS ERODE GRANITE AND BASALT IN THESE CHANNELS AND
PAD NOT EGODE MORAINE OR ICE AT THEIR HEADS.
MORAINE MIGHT BE YOUNBER AND YET SPOKANE IN AGE THE SUBGLACIAL VULOANISM HYPOTHESIS
PERMITS THE ICE SHEET TO REMAIN AFTER THE FLOOD.
THE MELTING OF A BIG HOLE TO THE NORTH WOULD
HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE MARGIN OR ON THE MAIN BODY OF THE ICE.

WHEN THIS FACT IS APPREdATED, THERE ARE CER-
TAIN EXTRAORDONARY FEATURES, TO BE DONSIDERED.
HORSESHOE LAKE CARRIES A HIGH ROCK PENINSULA WITH VERY STEEP SLOPES.
OF THE LAKE ARE LIKEWISE VERY HIGH AND PRECIPITOUS, UTTERLY UNSALABLE IN MOST PLACES.

ON THE EAST WAlL, MORE THAN HALF WAY DOWN TO THE LAKE, IS A GREAT POTHOLE IN THE GRANITE
(GRANOD 1ORITE?) ABOUT 40 WEET ACROSS AND OF UNKNOWNDEPTH.
IT WAS MADE WHEN, OR AFTER, THE
REMARKABLE BORGE WHICH CONTAMNS THE LAKE WAS CUT.
CLEARLY NOTHING BUT GLACIAL WATERS WERE
CONCERNED IN ITS MAKING.
WHE EAST WALL IS IN PART A HILL WTH GENTLER SLOPE WWAY FROM THE LAKE.
ITS PROFFLE, CONTIN-
UED WESTWARD, WOULD NOT FALL FAR SHORT OF JOINING THE GENTLER UPPER SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN TO
THE WEST. THE LOWER 9N7 STRONGLY RUBBED GRANITE HILLS TO THE EAST ARE TAKEN TO BE LARGELY
PREGLACIAL AND MODIFIED ONLY BY ICE ITSELF.
BUT THE GORGE ITSELF HAS BEEN OUT BY WATER INTO THE FLIKS AND PARALLEL TO THE LENGTH OF THE
MT. (N-S), OR IT HAS BEEN AT ANY RATE OCCUPIED BY WATER, IT MAY BE CLAIMED THAT THIS IS A KEYSTOEN
FAULT VALLEY, AND THERE WOULD BE LITTLE CHANCE OF DEMONSTRATING THE CONTRARY.
BUT THE INTERPRE-
TATION MOST IN HARMONY WITH ALL OTHER EVIDENGE IS THAT GLACIAL WATERS ERODED IT.
AND TO DO THIS
SEEMS CLEARLY TO DEMAND SOMETHING ELSE THAN LATERAL DRAINAGE SETWEEN MOUNTAIN TO THE WEST AND ICE
TO THE EAST.

ANOTHER. EXTRAORDINARY GROUP OF GORGES IS Apt THREE MILES NORTH OF THE WEST END OF SACHEEN
LaKE, AT THE Y IN THE ROAD SHOWN ON MAP.
HERE IS A GRANITE AND CRYSTALLINE ROCK RIDGE PROJECT-
ING EASTWARD FROM THE WAIN MOUNTAIN MASS OUT INTO THE LOWER COUNTRY.
IT IS CUT TO THE VERY
BASE BY THREE GREAT OLEFFS, THE EASTERN ONE OF WHICH IS USED BY THE ROAD TO CALISPEL LAKE.
THE WESTERN NOTCH OR CLEFT IS PROBABLY MORE THAN 300 FT DEEP AND HAS PRECIPITOUS SIDES. NO
STREAM IN IT, VERY NARROW AT THE BOTTOM.
THE MIDDLE NOTCH IS HARDLY A QUARTER OF A MILE TO THE


EAST AND IS SIMILAR IN DIMENSIONS AND PROPORTIONS EXCEPT THAT IT IS DOUBLE AT THE BOTTOM, A
PRECIPITOUS ROCKY HILL RISING MORE THAN 100 FEET IN THE MIDDLE.
EACH MEMBER OF THE DOUBLE
CLEFT IS EQUALLY NARROW, NEITHER POSSESSES A STREAM.
BOTH DF THESE BIG CLEFTS OCCUR IN A HIGH
PART OF THE RIDGE AND THERE IS NO SUGGESTION OF PREGLACIAL SLOPES OFTTHE REST LINE TOWARD THEM,
THE EASTERN CLEFT IS NOT MUCH MORE THAN 100 FEET DEEP THO ITS BOTTOM IS AS LOW AS THAT OF
THE OTHER TWO.
IT IS HALF TO THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE FROM THE MIDDLE CLEFT AND ITSELF IS
RATHER MORE LIKE A GORGE, FOR IT IS 1/4 TB 1/3 OF A MItE LONG WHILE THE OTHERS ARE SHORT.
ALSO
THERE AREGENTLER SLOPES OFITHE CREST LINE TOWARD IT, LONGER ON THE WEST SIDE.
THERE IS NO
STREAM IN THIS CLEFT.

A FLATTISH TRACT, PART
SWAMP, PART GRAVEL AND DRIFT, ABOUT A MILE WIDE, STRETCHES TWO MILES OR MORE TO THE NORTH TOWARD
CALISPEL WAKÉ VALLEY.
THE FACE OF THE EW RIDGE CUT BY THE NOTCHES IS AS PRECIPITOUS TOWARO THIS
LOW TRACT, AT LEAST IN PLACES, AS ARE THE WALLS OF THE NOTCHES OR CLEFTS.
TO THE SOUTH OF THE
RIDGE IS A VELLEY ABOUT A MILE WIDE WHICH LEADS OUT TO THE EAST.

WHAT WILL EXPLAIN THESE GREAT GASHES SO CLOSELY GROUPED, SO OUT OF HARMONY WITH ALL OTHER
SLOPES, WITHOUT STREAMS, TRENDING NORTH-SOUTH ACROSS THE HIGHER BASE OF AN EASTWARD SPUR OF THE
HIGBER MOUNTAINS TO THE WEST?
LATERAL DRAINAGE (ICE TO THE EAST, MTS TO THE WEST)?
AHARDLY POSSIBLE TO HOLD THE ICE HERE LONG ENOUGH, IMPOSSIBLE TO CUT THREE, TWO OF THEM HIGH. IN
THE RIDGE AND ONE OF THEM DOUBLE.
KEYSTONE FAULTING?
IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE OR DISPROVE IN
THE CRYSTALLINES, EXCEPT BY FINDING SLICKENSIDES.
BUT THE MECHANICS ARE DIFFICULT, FOR IF WED-
GES WERE DROPPED TO MAKE THESE CLEFTS, THE RIDGE INDEED, MUCH OF THE REGION) MUST HAVE BEEN PUSH-
ED OR PULLED OVER TO THE EAST (OR NORTHEAST, FOR THE CLEFTS REALLY STRIKE NW SE APPROXIMATELY) .
FURTHER, THE KEYSTONES SHOULD NOT LOGICALLY BY LIMITED TO THIS SHARP RIDGE BUT SHOULD SHOW UP IN
THE HIGHER MOUNTAIN SIDE TO THE NORTHWEST.
PERHAPS THEY DIE OUT ENOUGH ACROSS THE VAEEEY TO THE

JULY 23 1926
THE GORGE FOLLOWED BY THE LITTLE SPOKANE RIVER AND THE G.N.R,R. BETWEEN THESE TWO STATIONS
Is 2 1/2. TO 3 MILES LONG.
ITS WALLS ARE EXCEEDINGLY PRECIPITOUS, THO TALUS HAS CLIMBED CONSID-
ERABLY.
HEIGHT OF CLIFFS ABOVE THE VALLEY BOTTOM VARIES CONSIDERABLY FORTHE GORGE IS VERY
CLEARLY CUT ACROSS AN OLDER TOPOGRAPHY, BUT AN AVERAGE HEIGNY WOOLD BE ABOUT 300 FT. THE OLDER
TOPOGRAPHY IS NOT A VALLEY IN WHICH THE YOUTHFUL GORGE HAS BEEN ENTRENCHED.
IT IS THE IRREGULAR
CREST LINE OF A FAIRLY BROAD RIDGE OR DIVIDE, WITH HILLS ON IT 300 FEET OR SO IN HEIGHT ABOVE THE
SADDLES.
THE GORGE IS ESSENTIALLY IN A SADDLE THO IT SWINGS WaRD AGAINST OWN-BBE THE HILLS

THE PROBLEM OF THE ORIGIN OF THE GORGE IS ADMITTEDLY DIFFICULT BUT SURELY THE EXPLANATION
LIES IN THEEVENTS OF THE SPOKANE GLACIATION, FOR WISCONS IN WATERS FOUND THE GORGE ALREADY THERE

BUT IT IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO GET SEVERAL STREAMS TO DO THIS. AND SEVERAL STREAMS
DID THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO OTHER SUCH WITHIN: THREE MILES TO THE WEST OF THE ITTLE SPOKANE
Jer THE LITTLE SPOKANE IS PECULIAR, VERY PECULIAR, IN ANOTHER RESPECT. INDEED, IT SEEMS INEXPLIC
ABLE IN TERMS OF GLACIAL STREAMS ESCAPING FROM A MELTING I0 FRONT OR FROM A POND IN FRONT OF SUCH
A SHEET. THE PECULIARITY COMES TO LIGHT ONLY WHEN THE WESTERN CLIFF IS CLIMBED. AT S
AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF, BUT NOT THE SUMMIT OF THE RIDGE, IS A SMALL GORGE, CARVED IN
GRANITE, FROM 20 TO 120 FEET DEEP, PARALLEL OR SUBPARALLEL TO THE MAIN GORGE, AND SEPARATED FROM
IT BY A JAGGED, BARE OR NEARLY BARE, ROCK. BARRIER FROM 50 TO NEARLY 1000 FEET WIDE, WITH SLOPES

NOT ALONE THIS, BUT THE WALL BETWEEN THE SMALL PARALLEL GORGE AND THE MAIN CANYON IS CUT
THRU OR NEARLY THRU IN A DOZEN PLACES.
SOME OF THESE CUTS ARE SIMPLY NOTCHES IN THE WALL, OTHER
ARE LITTLE CANYONS.
THE DEEPEST OF THESE, HOWEVER, DRAINS BACK INTO THE LATERAL AND CANNOT
THEREFORE BE DUE TO WATER ESCAPING OVER TO THE MAIN CANYON FROM THE SUBPARALLEL SMALL GORGE.
THE LATERAL GORGE IS SWAMPY AND ELATFLOORED. THE ROCK KNOBS AND RIDGES WHICH CONSTITUTE THE
WALL ARE GREATLY SCOURED BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF GLACIAL ROUNDING SUCH AS THE GRANITE SHOWS
ELSEWHERE.
THIS LATERAL CANYON APPARENTLY DOES NOT HAVE ANY ENTRIßE INTO IT AT THE HEAD FROM GHE MAIN
CANYON.
IT DOES JOIN THE MAIN A MILE, OR A MILE AND A HALF FARTHER DOWN THE LITTLE SPOKANE, THO
HERE IT APPEARS THAT IT REALLY JOINS ANOTHER LATERAL WHICH HEADS IN ONE OF THE NOTCHES IN THE
SEPARATING WALL.

THERE IS NO GRAVEL AND NO GLACIAL DRIFT IN THIS TRACT. IT IS AS GOOD GRANITE SCABLAND
AS IN THE HEAD OF GRAND COULEE, EXCEP FOR DIMENSIONS.
ON THE EAST SIDE OF LITTLE SPOKANE CANYON WHERE THE ROAD CLIMBS OUT THERE IS APPARENTLY AN-
OTHER MARGINAL TRACT OF SCOURED HILLOCKS AND RIDGES AND A SMALL LATERAL CANYON.
IT WAS SEEN
ACROSS THE MAIN CANYON ONLY. HANG STEADON
MATHE ONLY LOGICAL EXPLANATION THAT OFFERS ITSELF FOR THESE FEATURES OF THE LITTLE SPOKANE GORGE
IS THAT WHICH SEEKS TO EXPLAIN THE SCABLANDS OF THE COLUMBIA PLATEAU BY SUBGLACIAL VULCAN ISM.
APPARENTLY AN ENGLACIAL RIVER HERE CROSSED THE RIDGE, AND THE LATERAL CANYON AND ITS NOTCHED WALL
RECORD THE EARLY FLOOR, BEFORE THE 300-FOOT CANYON WAS ERODED. ROCK SHOULDERS AND SCOURED BA
LEDGES AT THE VERY ENTRADE TO THE CANYON ARE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN OTHERWISE AND FIND AN ADEQUATE
EXPLANATION IN THIS CONCEPTION.
Tom Tuna is
DA FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE OTHER NOTCHES CLOSE TO #HIS LITTLE SPOKANE AFFAIR AND SIMILAR TO IT
IN BEING WHOLLY OUT OF HARMONY WITH THE OTHER RIDGE SLOPES AND CERTAINLY NOT DUE TO EROSION BY
GLACIAL ICE.
ONLY FAULTING OR THE VABARIES OF SUBGLACIAL RIVERS SEEMS ADEQUATE. AND WHY
FAULTING SHOULD ALWAYS CROSS RIDGES AND DROP KEYSTONES TO MAKE THESE CLEFTS IS DIFFICULT TO
ANSWER.
THERE ARE PLENTY OF SLICKENSIDES IN THE GRANITE IN ONE PLACE IN THE R OUTS BUT IT
IS CLEARLY RELATED TO THE MOUNTAIN MAKING WHICH TILTED THE METASED/MENTS, LONG BEFORE THE EROSION
WHEN THE RIDGE WAS FASHIONED.
A NOTCH OR CLEFT, STRIKINGLY LIKE THOSE NORTH OF SACHEEN LAKE, CROSSES THIS RIDGE A MILE WEST
OF THE UPPER PART OF THE LITTLE SPOKANE'S GORGE.
ISS SLOPES ARE VERYSTEEP, IT HAS PLENTY OF
ROCKY KNOBS AND SMALL RIDGES ON iTS FLANKS, WITH SHORT SIDE-HILL GORGES BETWEEN THEM AND THE MA IN
WALL, A FLOOR WHAT IS FAIRLY FLAT FOR A QUARTER OF A MILE OF ITS LENGTH ACROSS THE RIDGE AND A S
SWAMPY TRACT ON THE HIGHEST OF THE DOWNHILL SLOPE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CREST. THE CLEFT
IS CUT ABOUT AS LOW AS THE ALTITUDE OF THE DRIFT PLAIN TO THE NORTH.
IT IS 300 FT HIGHER THAN
THE BOTTOM OF THE LITTLE SPOKANE GORGE®YIAO THE NOTCH ITSELF MUST BE 300 FY DEEP. AT THE NORTH
END, OR ENTRANCE, OF THE NOTCH IS A DEPOSIT OF SPOKANE DRIFT WITH STRIATED BOULDERS. JAIT LIES
A LITTLE LOWER THAN THE FLOOR AT THE HIGH POINT. IN THE NOTCH AND THEREFORE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
A DEPOSIT IN THE NOTCH.
NOTCH NO 3 IS USED BY WE ROAD ACROSS BETWEEN SCOTIA ANC CAMDEN. IT IS TWO MILES WEST OF
THE LITTLE SPOKANE NOTCH AND AS A CLEFT CUT INTO A SADDLE, IT IS FAIRLY WELL MARGED.
ITS toe
SLOPES AND THE JOINING SLOPES SHOW THE SAME CONTRAST AS SLSEWHERE. THE NOTEW IS ABOUT 100 FT
DEEP AND WAS SOME ROCKY LEDGES/ THO NOT AS MANY AS IN THE TWO NOTCHES TO THE EAST.

APPARENTLY STANDING IN THE MOUTH OF THIS NOTCH OR SHORT GORGE IS A ROCK HILL 100 FT OF MORE
ABOVE THE NOTCH. FLOOR THE MAIN FLOOR IS ON THE WEST BUT ON THE EAST IS A LOW PLACE 60 FEET BELON
THE MID HILL SUMMIT, WITH SCOURED ROCK SURFACES SHOWING IN MOUNDED SHAPES. MAYA
ABOUT A MILE FARTHER WEST IS ANOTHER NOTCH (NO. 4) OR SHORT GORGE RIGHT ACROSS THE RIDGE.
ITS HIGHEST POINT IN MID-CHANNEL IS 200 FEET ABOVE THE ONE TRAVERSED BY THE ROAD. THERE ARE
ROCK LEDGES AND STEEP SLOPES FOR 100 FEET OR SO ABOVE ON EACH SIDE, THE AMOUNT OF DEEPENING IN
THE EPISODE WHICH MADE A NOTCH OR. SHORT CANYON OUT OF A SADDLE. THE GRADIENT ALONG THIS NOTCH
IS LOW AND IT CONTAINS A SWAMPY TRACT THRUOUT ABOUT MALF OF ITS LENGTH, WHICH TOTALS HALF A MILE.
THE SITUATION ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE MAIN RIDGE AT THE MOUTHS OF THESE TWO NOTCHES IS BEST
PORTRAYED BY A SKETCH MAP.
IT LOOKS VERY MUCH AS. THO A PREGLACIAL RAVINE HAD BEEN DEVELOPED
ALONG THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE MAIN RIDGE, CONTROLLED IN ORIENTATION PROBABLY BY THE DONGITUDINAL $
STRIKE OF THE METAMORPHOSED SEDIMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GRANITE OF THE RIDGE; AB THE CUTTING
OF THE EAST NOTCH HAD INVOLVED THE BREAKING DOWN IN TWO PLACES OF THE MINOR RIDGE ON THE SOUTH
SIDE OF THE RAVINE.

STILL ANOTHER NOTCH (NOTCH NO 5) IS CUT THRU THIS MUCH-NOTCHED PREGLACIAL DIVIDE BETWEEN
THE MTS. ALONG THE IDAHO LINE AND THE COLVILLE MTS. TO THE WEST.
IT IS NEARLY OPPOSITE THE
MADE BY THE TR HIWAY AND THE ROAD TO SACHEEN LAKE)N THE WEST PART OF THE DIAMONDLAKE FLAT.
IT IS NEARLY TWO MILES WEST OF THE MOST WESTERN NOTCH THUS FAR DESCRIBED (NOTCH NO.4)
IT DOES
NOT SHOW THE NOTABLE STEEPENING IN THE ORIGINAL LONGITUDINAL PROFILE, AT LEAST SO FAR AS SEEN,
BUT ITS WALLS ARE STEEP AND IT HAS A REMARKABLE GRANITE SCABLAND OVER ITS WiDE FLOOR. THE
LOWEST CHANNEL ACROSS THSS SCABLAND IS ABOUT 200 FEET ABOVE THE DIAMOND LAKE FLAT.
THE HIGHER
CHANNELS ARE AT LEST 50 FEET ABOVE.
THE TOPOGRAPHY IS CHARACTERIZED BY GRANITE KNOBS, RATHER
THAN CHANNELS.
CHANNEL WAYS ARE HERE, LEADING FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, BUT #BEY ANASTOMOSE CONGUSEDLY.
THE KNOBS ARE OF DIFFERENT ALTITUDES, SOME NEARLY OR QUITE 100 FT ABOVE THE LOWEST CHANNEL, AND ONE
HAVING A WALL 60 FEET HIGH.
THE BARE GRANITE IS VERY MUCH IN EVIDENCE BUT IT DOES NOT SHOW
THE ROUND/ACED, WEATHERED ROCHE MOUTONEE FORMS WHICH IRE CONSPICUOUS A MILE OR SO DISTANT IN
THE DIAMOND LAKE DEPRESSION.
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN THIS BARE GRANITE IN THE BOTTOM
OF THIS NOTCH AS GLACIALLY ERODED.
IT IS THE PRODUCT OF A TREMENDOUSLY EFFECTIVE TORRENT
WHICH WAS POURED THRU THIS NOTCH UNDER SOME SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF THE SPOKANE EPOCH.
THE


CONDITIONS DEMANDED A SIMILAR FUNCTIONING OF EACH OF THE OTHER FOUR NOTCHES ALREADY DESCRIBED.
AND THERE APPEARS TOE A FIFTH (SIXTH?), STILL FARTHERWEST, THO NOT AS FAR AS THE LOW PLACE USEd
BY THE TR HIWAY IN CROSSING THIS RIDGE. FIVE REMARKABLE STREAM-CUT NOTCHES. IN ABOUT 6 MILES OF

DOES NOT THIS ESTABLISH THE CONTENTION THAT Z CANYON AND THE NOT
NE OF NEWPORT (1925 NOTES) ARE OFTHE SAME GENESIS AS THOSE IN THE OKANOGAN VALLEY AND THESE FIVE

ON THE EAST AND BY ROCK CLIFFS AND ROCK KNOBS ON THE WEST THAT ARE GRANITE SCABLAND, EXACTLY LIKE
THAT IN NOTCH 5 AND LIKE THAT 300 FEET ABOVE THE LAKE A MILE OR MORE TO THE NORTH. THERE IS NO
CONTINUOUS CLIFF ON THE WEST SIDE.

NO FIELD EVIDENCE FOR GLACIAL EROSION, APPARENTLY NO POSSIBILITY OF EXPALINING IT BY
THE MECHANICS OF GLACIAL ICE OPERATING IN SUCH A GORGE.

DIAMOND LAKE TO NELSON,B.C.
SUNDAY JULY 25 1926
THE VALLEY OF CLARKS FORK NORTH FROM NEWPORT TO METALINE FALLS IS BENERALLY CAPACIOUS, IN SOME
PLACES SEVERAL MILES WIDE. BUT FOR A FEW MILES NEAR RUBYIT IS CONSTARTED BY LOW MOUNTAINS AND
HILLS, THO THE RIVER HERE DOES NOT FLOW OVER ROCK LEDGES. SO FAR AS COULD BE SEEN, THIS 18
NOT DUE TO SUPERPOSITION ON A MOUNTAIN SPUR OF THE PREGLA@CAL VALLEY BUT IS A REAL CONSTRiCTION
OF THE BALLEY.
APPARENTLY THE BROAD PORTIONS OF THE VALLEY ARE STRUCTURAL AND THE CONSTRICTED
PLACE ISWHOLLY EROSIONAL, PROBABLY BY PREGLACIAL SEREAMS.
BUT THE SITUATION AT METALINE FALLS AND Z CANYON IS SO MUCH MORE OF A CONSTRICTION THAT
THE CNNYONING, THE FALLS AND THE RAPIDS HERE MUST BE DUE TO GLACIAL SUPERPOSITION OF THE PRESENT
STREAM ON A PREGLACIAL DIVIDE. THERE NEVER WAS A PREGLACIAL DRAINAGE LINE ACROSS HERE.
BOX
CANYON, A FEW MILESSOUTH OF METALINE, MAY BE ON A SPUR BUT NOT THE ENSEMBLE NORTH OF METALINE..
HOW MUCH THE RIVER DESCENDS FROM METALINE TO THE MOUTH OF THE NYONING SOULD BE ASCERTAINED,
IF POSSIBLE.
THERE ARE GREAT #77$ DEPOSITS OF GLACIAL TILL AND GRAVEL ALONG THE HIWAY NORTH OF METAL-
INE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE RIVER.
THE TRIBUTARIES TO THE PEND OREILLE FORM THIS SIDE ARE
SHORT AND HAVE VERY STEEP-WALLED RAVINES CUT IN THE DRIFT.
LITTLE CAN BE SEEN FROM THE ROAD EXCEPT NORTH OF Z CANYON TRAIL.
BUT HERE IS A VERY
INTERESTING COUNTRY.
IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH HILLS OF ROCK, SEVERAL HUNDREO FEET ABOVE
THEIR BASES, VERY STEEP TO PRECIPITOUS, STRONGLY SCOURED BY THE WISCONSIN ICESHEET, SHORT
-AND
ENTIRELY SEPARATED BROM EACH OTHER BY GORGES OR TRENCHES CUT IN ROCK AND ANASTOMOSING FREELY WITH
EACH OTHER. MANY LAKES LIE IN THESE SEPARATING TENCHES, DUE OF COURSE TO BLOCKING BY DEPOSITS
OF WISC. ORIRT. NO ROCK BASINS TO BE RECOGNIZED BECAUSE OF THE DRIFT DEPOSITS ON THE FLOORS.
BUT COULD THE WISCONS IN ICE HAVE MADE THIS TRACT OF GASHES, 400 TO PERHAPS 1000 FEET DEEP, AMONG
THESE HILLS?
COULD THE HILLS HAVE SURVIVED GLACIAL EROSION WHICH MADE THE RELATIVELY NARROW
TRENCHES?
ORIENTATION OF MAWOR TRENCHES AND ROCK HILLS IS PREVAILINGLY NORTH-SOUTH. NO
EVIDENCE THAT STRUCTURAL. ÖR ROCK DIFFERENCES MAY HABE BEEN THE DETERMINERS. IT SEEMS VERY PLAU-
SIBLE TAX TO CONSIDER THESE HILLS AND TRENCHES, HGIH ABOVE THE SALMON TO THE NORTH, AS PRODUCED
BY THE SAME EXTRAOBP I NARY CAUSE WHICH MADE THE NOTCHES SOUTH OF DIAMOND LAKE, BUT FURTHER
EXAMINATION MUST BE MADE.
VALLEY OF SALMON RIVER, A TRIBUTARY OF THE PEND OREILLE FROM THE NORTH, JOINS THE MA IN RIVER
Xedit/ ALMOST AT 180° TO ITS COURSE.
AT THE JCT., THE PEND OREILLE TURNS WESTWARD TO JOIN Y
THE COLUMBIA.
ON THE MAP, THE SALMON WOULD MAKE A NICE ORIGINAL HEADWATERS OF AN ORIGINALLY
SOUTH-FLOWING $/% A PEND OREILLE, A LATER DIVERSION HAVENG REVERSED THD PEND OREILLE AN THE USA
AND TAKEN THE WATER WESTWARD BY A NEW ROUTE.


BUT THE FIELD EVIDENCESARE MUCH AGAINST THIS INTERPRETATION.
THE SALMON VALLEY, AT JOT X
WITH THE PEND OREILLE, IS A FINE EXAMPLE OF A MOUNTAIN RIVER VALLEY OCCUPIED AND MODIFIED BY eX
GLACIAL EROSION. THIS IS A WEW MILES NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY.
1 THE SAMONS BOTTOM IS FAR
BELOW THETRENCH FLOORS AMID THE ROCK HILLS, AND APPARENTLY THE PEND OREILLE COURSE BELOW Z CAN-
YON IS THE OLD SALMON.
THIS MUST BE RE-EXAMINED NOWEVER.
SIDES OF SALMON VALLEY VERY MOCH SCOURED AND SPURS CUT AWAY TO STRAIGHTEN THE VALLEY.
GRADIENT GENTLE AND UNIFORM.
THIS IS TRUE UP THE VALLEY APPROXIMATELY TO YMIR.
BUT HERE
FOR SEVERAL MILES, THE FLOOR OF THE VALLEY. IS DIVERSIFIED BY ROCK KNOBS AND HILLS, APPARENTLY OF
GRAMITE, THAT STAND AS MUCH As 100 FEET ABOVE THE STREAM, THAT OBSTRUCT THE VALLEY, THAT CAUSE THE
STREAM TO WIND ABOUT AND TO CUT SHORT CHANYONS THRU THEM, AND THAT ARE ALSO DEFERTED//N/ DEPICTED
IN THE WINDING COURSE OF THE GRR BRANCH LINE TO NELSON.
THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS OF ANYTHING LIKE SIDE WILL LATERAL GASHES, LIKETHOSE IN THE
OKANOGAN COUNTRY•
THESE FEATURES ABOVE YMIR ARE ALL IN THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY.
THEY ARE
TAKEN TO RECORD PLUCKING BY GLACIAL ICE IN JOINTED GRANITE.
THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE KOOTENAY AND THESALMON HAS BEEN CUT THRU, PRESUMBBLY BY ICE FROM THE
NORTH, AND NOW CONTAINS LAKES ON THE BROAD COL.
THE ASPECT IS VERY SIMILARTO THAT OF THE NOTCH
OR PASS NORTH OF ALADDIN.
THE HYPOTHESIS NOW USED CAN NOT HAVE THIS A SUBGLACIAL STREAM NOTCH,
NOTE ON CHAIN LAKES-CHA#N LAKE, ROCK-BASIN BY THE SPOKANE GLACIATION, OCCUPIED AND
PRESUMABLY FILLED BY THE WISCONSIN V.T. IS TODAY A BASIN. THIS ANOMALY CAN BE EXPAINED, HOWEVR
BY USING THE DISCHARGE OF LAKE CLARK TO FLUSH OUT THE GRAVEL AFTER THE V.T. CEASED TO GROW.
AND
THE VOLUMEN OF LAKE CLARK"S DISCHARGE SEEMS ADEQUATE, IF PUT THRU THIS NARROW PLACE. THE DEEP
CHANNEL ACROSS THE PEND OREILLE LITTLE SPOKANE DIVIDE INDICATES THIS.

CLASTIC DIKES OF COARSE GRAVEL IN A FEW PLACES. THEY OCCUR AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AND CLEARLY

ON THE EROSIONAL SLOPES.
THESE TWO TERRACES ARE PRESENT IN FRAGMENTS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE MOUTH OF THE PEND OREILLE
THE UPPER LIMIT OF 1900 IS 200 FEET HIGHER THAN PARDEES FIGURE FOR THE NESPELEM UPPER LIMIT.
NEVERTHELESS, THE REMARKBBLE CONTINUITY FROM THE KOOTENAY TO THE PEND OREILLE AND AGAIN IN WASH-
LINGTON SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THERE IS ONE GREAT SILT DEPOSIT WHOSE SURFACE RISES GRADUALLY TOWARD
THE NORTH.
NEITHER THE PEND OREILLE, THE SALMON OR THE BEAVER CREEK VALLEYS SHOWED THE SILT TERRACES.
PEND OREILLE VALLEY FROM THE COLUMBIA UP TO THE MOUTH OF THE SAMON IS A GREAT GORGE-LIKE
AFFAIR; NARROW, STEEP- WALLED, THE RIVER TUMBLING IN MANY RAPIDS AND CASCADES THRUOUT THIS DIST-
ANCE.
MUCH OR MOST OF THIS COURSE IS MARGINED WITH ROCK LEDGES; RIVER CARVED, NOT GLACIATED.
INDEED, THE VALEY SHOWS NO GOOD EVIDENCE OF STRONG GLACIATION.
THE BESCENT FROM THE MOUTH OF
THE SALMON (ABOUT 1700 TO THE COLUMBIA (ABOUT 1300) IS 400 FEET AND THE DISTANCE IS ABOUT 15 MI.
THIS WHOLE STRETCH IS VERY YOUTHFUL.
IT IS MUCH YOUNGER THAN THE WIDE SALMON VALLEY, WITH
ROOM FOR ROAD, RAILROAD, SMALL FIELDS AND HERE AND THERE A TOWN.
FURTHERMORE, THERE IS A TRANSVERSE VALLEY ACROSS FROM SALMO TO COLUMBIA GARDENS, ABOUT 20 MI.
LONG, WITH A GRADIENT OF 200 FEET IN 18 MILES, WITH WIDTH FOR FARMS ALL THE WAY, WITH ITS DIVIDE
OCCUPIED BY TWO ORHTHREE LAKES, WITH THE DIVIDE IN IT ONLY FIVE MILES FROM SALMO. IN THE SALMON
VALLEY AND VERY LITTLE ABOVE SALMO.
A THRU VALLEY! IT CAN ONLY BE AN OLD COURSE OF THE
SALMON.
THE RECONSTRUCTION HERE WOULD TURN SOUTH FORK, LOST CREEK AND SHEEP CREEK NORTHWARD
TO SALMO TO JOIN THE SALMON FROM THE NORTH, THE UNITED STREAMS FLOWING THENCE WESTWARD F$ TO
THE COLUMBIA AT COLUMBIA GARDENS.


WHEN THE ENTRANCE OF THIS OLD VALLEY, NOW OCCUPIED BY BEAVER CREEK, INTO THE COLUMBIA
VALLEY IS EXAMINED, IT IS FOUND TO BE REMARKABLY HANGING.
IT MOUTHS ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE HIGH
TERRACE, FULLY 550 FEET ABOVE THE COLUMBIA. THIS, THEN, IS A MEASURE OF THE DEPTH OF THE GLAC-
IAL EROSION PERFORMED IN THE COLUMBIA VALLEY HERE. IT IS SURPRISINGLY GREAT BUT ROCK SHOULDERS
ALONG THE COULMBIA NEAR TRAIL, ABUT 500 FEET ABOVE THE COLUMBIA, SEEM TO RECORD REMNANTS OF THE
PREGLACIAL FLOOR.
CHANGE OF THE PEND OREILLE DRAINAGE TO CROSS THE BARRIER AT M-TALINE FALLS AND Z CANYON, AND
TO FLOW THENCE TO THE COLUMBIA REQUIRES SOME SPECIAL EXPLANATION.
THE REVERSAL OF THE SAUMON
FROM SALMO TO JCT OF SOUTH FORK AND THE JOINING WITH THE PEND OREILLE REOUIRES THE SAME EXPLAN-
ATION.
WHAT THAT IS, IS NOT CLEAR. IT SEEMS ALTOGETHER TOO FAR FETCHED TO DRAG IN THE SUBGLAC -
[AL RIVER HYPOTHESIS FOR THERE ARE NO GOOD EVIDENCES IN VIEW OF SUCH STREAMS ABOUT TRAIL OR COLUM-
BIA GARDENS, OR WANITA, OR ALONG THE LOWER PEND OREILLE.
THE NORTH WALL OF THE PEND OREILLE
VALLEY WAS NOT SEEN ,
THE DRIFT IS THICK ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE VALLEY AND THE FOREST COVERS
OR LARGELY COVERS EVERYTHING AND OBSCURES THE VIEW.
THE ONLY ITEM TO BE ADDED FROM TODAY'S TRIP REGARDING THE LAKES AND HILLS ABOUT THE CANADA
CUSTOMS STATION ON THE NELSON-SPOKANE HIWAY IS THAT CUSTOMS STATION IS ABOUT 2400 ALT., PERHAPS
100 FEET ABOVE THE AVERAGE ALTITUDE OF THE LAKES.
5100 FT. MT. ON BOUNDARY TRAIL EAST OF CANADA CUSTOMS HAS ORACIAL DRIFT° I TOP. BUT THERE

INDICATING AT LEAST THIS DEPTH OF GLACIAL EROSION, THO MOW MUCH WAS PRE-WISCONSIN IS DIFFICULT TO
SAY.
SILT PROBLEM
NO. SILTS SEEN IN SHEEP CREEK VALLEY AND NO TERRACES WHICH MIGHT BE SILT.
BUT THE TRIBUTARY VALLEY FROM THE WEST, FOLLOWED BY THE HIWAY, HAS EXPOSURES OF SILT ALONG THE

TRAIL BUT IS VERY MUCH HIGHER. NO SILT OR SILT TERRACES SEEN IN CHRISTINA LAKE VALLEY.
ALL

DIVIDE BETWEEN DOG CREEK AND MORE CREEK IS A NARROW CANYON WIMH VERY STEEP WALLS.
AT COR-
YELL, THE VALLEY OF MORE CREEK IS 1000 FT DEEP AND HARDLY 100 FT WIDE AT THE BOTTOM; ALL OUT OF
PROPORTION TO THE TINY STREAM HERE. AT THE DIVIDE IS ELAT MEADOW LAND, ACCORDING TO REPORT.
IF SUBGLACIAL WATERS EVER WERE IN ARROW LAKE, THEY MIGHT WELL HAVE COME STRAIGHT SOUTH ACROSS TO
THE KETTLE AT CASCADE BY WAY OF THIS DEEPLY NOTCHED DIVIDE.
CERTAINLY THE DIVIDE HERE IS WHOLLY
UNLIKE ANY OTHER SUMMITS YET SEEN IN THIS DISTRICT. AND IT IS DIFFICUT TO EXPLAIN IT AS DUE
TO ICE DIRECTLY.

CHRISTINA LAKE TO GREENWOOD JULY 29 1926 .
Sere healer Lieu
ANOTHER EXAMINATION OF THE SIDE MILL GASHES ABOUT CHRISTINA LAKE &ND CASCADE SHOWSTTHEM TO
BE MUCH LESS MARKED AFFAIRS THAN/DESCRIBED YESTERDAY.
THEY DO EXIST BUT THEY MAY PERHAPS
BE DUE TO GLACIAL EROSION.•
GLACIAL EROSION IN DEEPENING THESE VALLEYS SEES TO HAVE LEFT
MANY KNOBS NEARLY AS HIGH/ AS THE ORIGMINAL ROCK FLOORS. THIS IS TO BE APPLIED TO SALMON RIVER
VAKLEY ABOUT YMIR, TO THE COLUMBIA ABOUT TRAIL, TO THE KETTLE VALLEY ABOUT CASCADE AND ESPECIALLY
MARKED AT GRAND FORKS, AND TO THE BOUNDARY CREEK VALLEY AT GREENWORD.
PREGLACIAL SLOPES ARE
RECOGN@ZED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE KNOB TOPS BY THEIR GENTLER SLOPE, AND THE FACT THAT THE STRONGLY
GLACIATED, BARE, STEEP ALIGNED VALLEY SLOPES ARE SELDOM HIGHER UP THE VALLEY SIDES THAN THE HIGHER
OF THESE KNOBS.
HANGING VALLEY RELATIONSHIPS ALSO INDICATE THE SAME THING.
THESE SIDE HILL GASHES ARE NCT MUCH HIGHER THAN THE OTHER EVIDENCES OF STRONG GLACIAL EROSION
THEIR FORM, HOWEVER, CANNOT BE ASCRIBED TO CONTROL BY STRUCTURE UNDER GLACIAL PLUCKING OR
GRINDING FOR IN THE TWO BETTER ONES, NEITHER JOINTING NOR CLEAVAGE ARE PARALLEL OR EVERN SUB-
PARALLEL TO THEIR ELONGATION.
THE LARGEST OF ALL IS IN THE BPSTREAM ANGLE BETWEEN CHRISTINA LAKE VALLEY AND SUTHERLAND CR.
VALLEY. IT IS NOT A RIDGE, AS DESCRIBE YESTERDAY, BUT AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE.
SUMMIT IS
1400 ABOVE TH LAKE AND NOTCH BACK OF IT IS 300 FEET DEEP THIS NOTCH MAY BE DUE TO NOTHING MORE
THAN THE HEADING TOGETHER OF TWO TRIBUTARY VALLEYS, DEEPENED BY GLACIAL EROSION, BUT IT LOOKS
TOO MARKED EVEN FOR THIS.
I THERE IS A ROCK KNOB IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, AND THERE APPEARS TO
BE A SMALLER NOTCH OR SIDE HILL GASH A A/LL LITTLE HIGHER UP ON THE HIGHLAND SIDE.
THIS
TRAINGULAR HILL HAS VERY STEEP SLOPES TOWARD THE LAKE, MUCH STEEPER THAN TOWARD THE NOTCH. YET
THE SIPES OF THE NOTCH ARE STEERER THAN PREVAILING PREGLACIAL SLOPES ABOVE THE CLIFFED PORTIONS
OF THE LAKE VALLEY.
AND THE SPUR TO THE NORTH AND THE SPUR TO THE SOUTH BOTH HAVE TWO OR THREE NOTCHED PLACES/U
WHICH IN THEMSELVES ARE NOT NOTABLE BUT MAY BE SIGNIFICANT WHEN CONSIDERED WITH THIS PARTICULAR
300 FOOT NOTCH.
TERRACES IN KETTLE VALLEY AT CASCADE ARE ALL OF GRAVEL.
THEIR ALTITUDES ARE ROUGHLY
1750, 1650 AND 1550
NO SILT TERRACES IN THE REGION. A LONG ROCK SPUR PROJECTS OUT FROM THE
NORTH INTO THE KETTLE VALLEY HALFWAY FROM CASCADE TO LAURIER.
IT IS CROSSED BY KETTLE RIVER
IN THE VERY NARROW GORGE WHERE THE POWER PLANT IS LOCATED.
THE SPUR IS VERY GREATLY ERODED
BY GLACIAL ICE.
EAT ANY


NO SILTS IN KETTLE VALLEY FROM CASCADE TO GRAND FORKS.
GRAVEL TERRACES HERE AND THERE,
PARTICULARLY A FEW MILES WEST OF GRAND FORKS.
FOUR SUCH TERRACES, EACH SEPARATED BROM THE OTHER
BY ABOUT 50 IN ALTITUDE, ALL GRAVEL. UPPERMOST IS ONLY A FRAGMENT BUT THE OTHERS ARE VERY
EXTENSIVE.
SILTS, HOWEVER, OCCUR. IN TWO OR THREE TERRACE FRAGMENTS UP THE NORTH FORK OF
KETTLE RIVER (GRANBY RIVER) FOR A FEW MIEES.
THESE SEEM TO INDICATE VERY LOCAL LATERAL
PONDS, FOR THE NORTH FORK OR THE MAIN KETTLE CERTAINLY ARE NOT COMPETENT TO HAVE CLEANED ALMOST
ALL OF A, SILT DEPOSIT FROM THEIR VALLEYS WHILE THE GREAT COLUMBIA, IN A VALLEY NOT WIDER THAN
THE KETTLE AT GRAND FORKS, HAS SCARCELY MORE THNN TRENCHED INTO ITS SILT DEPOSIT.
THE TERR
ACES ON THE COLUMBIA MAKE A CONTINUOUS BORDER, EITHER ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER OF THE VALLEY.
171 30
GRANBY RIVER VALLEY (NORTH FORK KETTLE ) JULY 30 1926
TRAVERSE UP TO THE FORKS OF BURRELL CREEK. RISE IN RIVER LEVEL OF 500 FT FROM GRAND FKS.
ISNT THIS TWÉ RISE OF 500 FT IN 20 MILES ALTOGETHER TOO LOW A GRADIENT FOR ANY VALLEY GLACIER TO
ERODE ON?
THE GRANBY VALLEY IS TREMENDOUSLY ERODED.
THE ABSENCE OF FOREST ON MANY SLOPES
BECAUSE OF FIRES, SHOWS THIS FEATURE VERY STRIKINGLY.
SEVERELY RUBBED SLOPES/ASCEND TO THE VERY
SUMMITS OF THE BORDERING HILLS AND MTS., 3000 FT OR SO ABOVE THE STREAM.
HANGING VALLEY
RELATIONS SEEN IN SEVERAL TRIBUTARIES, INDICATING A GLACIAL DEEPENING OF 500 FT., &S FAR UP AS
THE BURRELL CREEK FORKS.
THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS ABOUT GLACIAL EROSION BY AN ICE SHEET RIDING OVER A MOUNTAINOUS MASS
THAT I DONT KNOW.
ONE VERY CURIOUS 7/N SITUATION IS AT AND JUST ABOVE THE JCT OF GRANBY
AND KETTLE.
GREAT ROCK HILLS SEEM TO FILL THE VALLEY THO THERE GRE PASSES AMONG THEM SO THAT
THEY STAND ISOLATED. ONE ESPECIALY PROMINENT ONE RISES IMMEDIATELY NORTH OR NORTHWEST OF GR.FKS.
IT MUST BE 400 FT ABOVETHE TOWN.
BETWEEN TWO ATHERS, THE GRANBY ESCAPES IN A NARROW GORGE FROM
ITS BROAD OPEN VALLEY FARTHER NORTH.
THESE KNOBS HAVE BEEN GREATLY ERODED BY GLACIAL ICE, AND
SEEM TO BE REMNANTS OF TBE PREGLACIAL FLOOR.
IF THIS BE THE CASE, THEN THE BROAD VALLEY ABOVE
THESE HALF DOZEN KNOBS AS FAR AS LYNCH CREEK MUST BE A "ZUNGENBECKEN", BY GLACIAL EROSION.
ANOTHER CURIOUS PLACE IS A MILE ABOVE THE JOT OF LYNCH CREEK
HERE THE VALLEY IS SHARPLY
OFFSET FOR HALF A MILE OR SO, THE OFFSET BEING VERY NARROW ANDTHE ROCK SHOULDERS ON EACH SIDE
BEING GREATLY GASHED AND ERODED INTO KNOBBY AND PINNACLED SUMMITS.
ABOVE THIS CONSTRICTION
IS ANOTHER BROAD VALLEY STRETCH UP TO THE FORKS, LIKE THAT BELOW.
ANOTHER "ZUNGENBECKEN"?
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO OTHER LOGICAL EXPLANATION EXCEPT THAT OF STRUCTURAL DEPRESSIONS, AND 7
THERE IS NO EDENCE OF THESE IN THIS GREATLY ERODED MT. MASS.
GASHES AND SIDE-HILL NOTCHES OR CLEFTS ARE PRESENT ALONG THE BRANGY BUTMOST OF THEM ARE BELOW
THE LEVEL OF MAXIMUM GLACIAL EROSION AND THEREFORE MUXT BE ASCRIBED TO PLUCKING iN A CURIOUS FASH-
ION.
BUT ON THE MT. SLOPES WEST OF THE FORKS OF THE RIVER, IS A SERIES OF SIDE HILL NOTCHES
THAT DO NOT SEEM TO BE OF THIS ORIGIN.
THREE GREAT SPURS ARE TRENCHED IN A LINE PARALLEL TO THE
VALLEY, THE NOTCH FLOORS BEING ABOUT 700-800 FEET ABOVE THE RIVER AND THE KNOBS OR RIOGES LEFT BE-
TWEEN 7AMi/ VALLEY AND NOTCHES STANDING 300 TO 800 FEET ABOVE THE NOTCH FLOORS.
TWO LAKES SHOWN
ON THE MAP IN ONE OF THESE NOTCHES AND TWO TRIBUTARIES ORIENTED PARALLEL TO THE MAIN VALLEY.
NOW, THESE NOTCHES ARE CLEARLY GLACIATED BY THE WISCONSIN ICE, CONSIDERABLY RUBBED.
BUT WErE X
THEY MADE BY THE WISC. ICE?
THE 800-FT NOTCH SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN THIS WAY..
IF SUB-


GLACIAL VULCANISM IS EVER ESTABLISHED FOR THE SPOKANE EPOCH, THESE NOTCHES WIL BE PUT IN THE
CATEGORY OF SUBGLACIAL STREAM COURSES.
VICINITY OF HOLT IS CONSIDERABLY DIFFERNT FROM THE COUNTRY YET SEEN.
IT IS A REGION OF
LOW MTS. THAT SEEM ISOOATED OR SEMI- ISOLATED BY UNDULATING LOWER RELIEF, DRIRT-COVERED OR WITH
LOW ROCK HILLS.
LOOKS LIKE A PREGLACIAL TOPOGRAPHY OF LATE MATURITY ON THE UPLANDS. IT IS
A DIVIDE REGION TODAY, ESPECIALLY HIGH BECAUSE OF THE DEEP GLACiAL EROSION IN KETTLE, GRANBY AND
BOUNDARY CREEK
THERE HAS BEEN GLACIAL EROSION ON THESE HILLS BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN PRONOUNCED.
BOUNDARY CREEK FROM HOLT TO WITHIN 8 MILES OF GREENWOOD SHOWS NO VALLEY DEEPENING BY GLACIAL
EROSION.
THE VALLEY HERE IS NEARLY EW AND PERHAPS THIS IS THE REASON, FOR THE ICESHEET MOVED
ACROSS, RATHER THAN ALONG.
BUT THERE IS DEEPENING AND THE PRODUCTION OR ROCK HILLS IN THE
VALLEY IN THE LOWER PART OF THE EW PART, AND THENCE TO GREENWOOD WHERE GLACIAL EROSION HAS BITTEN
PERHAPS 300 FT DEEP.
GREENWOOD TO BEAVERDELL
JULY 31 1926
A NOTABLE CONSTRICTION IN BDRY CREEK VALLEY A FEW MILES BELOW GREENWOOD.
THIS IS IN THE
GLACIALLY ROPE DEEPENED PORTION AND IS NOT BO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PREGLACIAL VALLEY. THE SAME
RESTRICTION APPLIES ALSO TO THE GRAB RIVER CONSTRICTION BOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN GRAB FORKS AND
THE FORKS OF BURRELL ANd CREEK AND BRANBY-RIVER,
BUT THE CHARACTER OF THE VALLEY CHANGES AT DRY FALLS ANC ROCK CREEK TOWN.
HERE IT RESEM
BLES THE VALLEYS IN NORTHERN WASHINGTON, SHOWING NO NOTABLE DEEPENING, BEING CAPACIOUS, HAVING
TERRACES OF DRIFT AND GRAVEL DISCONTINUOUS, NARROW AFFAIRS, ON THE LOWER SLOPES.
THESE ARE OF THE SAME GENESIS AS THOSE IN WASHINGTON, BUILT ALONG THE EDGE OF WANING TONGUES OF ICE
IN THE VALLEYS.
A PROBLEM WHICH SHOULD BE SOLVED FROM THE FIELD EVIDENE ARISES HERE.
IF THESE B.C. VALLEYS
HAVE HAD THE GLACIAL DEEPENWG HERE ATTRIBUTED 00 THEM, AND IF THE VIGOR OF GLACIAL DEEPINING IS
MUCH LESS MARKED ACROSS THE LINE IN WASHINGTON, THERE SHOULD BE SOME RECOGNIZABLE FEATURES TO RE-
CORD THIS.
DECREASE IN GRADIENT OF ROCK FLOOR MIGHT EXIST BUT BE CONCEALED B STREAM GRAVELS
AND TILL DEPOSITED DURING THE WANING STAGES.
NARROW VALLEYS SHOULD BROADEN DOWNSTREAM. ROCK
KNOBS AND ALIGNED STEEPENED SIDES SHOULD DISAPPEAR,
HANGING VALLEYS SHOULD DISAPPEAR.
SPURS
SHOULD BE IN EVIDENCE.
ARE THESE THINGS RECOGNIZABLE?
THE MYSTERY OF THE ABSENCE OF SIDE HILL GASHES, NOTCHED SPURS AND CLEFT DIVIDES IS DEEPENING.
IF SUBGLACIAL WATERS MADE THEM FARTHER SOUTH, OR EVEN IF LATERAL STREAMS MADE THEM DURING THE
WANING STAGES OF THE GLACIATION, WHY SHOULD THEY NOT BE HERE AS WELL AS IN WASHINGTON?
ONE
POSSIBLE ANSWER IS THAT WISCONSIN GLACIATION WAS SO VIGOROUSLY EROSIVE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WUPED
OUT.
ANOTHER IS THAT THE WATERS FROM THE VOLCANIC MELTING WOULD FLOW OVER THE SURFACE INSTEAD
OF SUBGLACIALLY, UNTIL NEARER THE MARGIN WHERE HE ICE WAS THINNER AND MORE FISSURED.
BUT IN
REBUTTAL TO THE LATTER SUGGESTION, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MECHANISM FOR
EJECTION OF WATER PRODUCED BY MELTING OF ICE IN SITU IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ICE CAP, OTHER THAN
STEAM EXPLOSIONS.


WOUDD NOT THE WATER SO PRODUCED FLOAT THE ICECAP, OR PORTIONS OF IT? IF A PAIL OF WATER
BE FROZEN SOLID, THEN MELTED FROM BELOW, AS SOON AS THE ICE IS FREE FROM THE SIDES OF THE VESSEL
IT WILL FLOAT, EVEN THO WHERE BE ONLY A FILM OF WATER SURROUNDING IT.
BY THIS VIEW, ALL THE
WATER WOULD STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THE CCE AFFECTED BOULD BE LIFTED OFF THE ICE-BURIED MTS.
BEAVERDELL TO COOKSON
AUGUST 1 1926
PERHAPS THE GREAT FIND OF THE SEARCH FOR THE CAUSE OF THE SPOKANE FLOOD HAS BEEN MADE TODAY!
A PART OF A VALLEY FLOW OF BASALT HAS BEEN LOCATED IN KETTLE RIVER VALLEY AT COOKSON.
CORDOB-
ORATIVE EVIDENCE OF STRIKING CHARACTER ALSO EXISTS IN THIS VALLEY BETWEEN LOIS AND COOKSON.
BEAVERDELL REGION OF KEYTLE RIVER VALLEY SHOWS LITTLE THAT CAN BE ASCRIBED DEFINITELY TO
GLACIAL EROSION.
THERE IS AN INTERRUPTED PROFILE TO THE SLOPES AND THE SPURS BUT THE ANdALAK
ANGLE IN IT LIES SO FAR UP THE SLOPES THAT IT SEEMS BETTER TO INTERPRET IT AS THE UPPER VALLEY
WALL LIMIT IN THE TRENCHING OF THE PRESENT DRAINAGE SYSTEM INTO THE ROLLING SURFACE OF THE OLD
PENEPLA IN.
A FEW LONE MOUNTAINS, STANDING ABOVE THE GENERAL EVEN SUMMIT LEVEL, SEEM TO BE
MONADNOCKS OF THE PENEPLAIN CYCLE.
IF THE INTERRUPTED PROFILE IS NOT DUE TO GLACIAL EROSION, THEN TIERE IS ALMOST NO EVIDENCE
FOR CHANGES IN VALLEY PROPORTIONS HERE.
SPURS OVERLAP IN THE VIEW DOWN THE VALLEY FROM CARMI:
A DENSE FOREST GROWTH ON ALL SLOPES SHOWS THAT THERE IS AN ADEQUATE SOIL COVER; IN CONTRAST WITH
THE SPARSE FOREST AND ABUNDANT BARE ROCK SLOPES AND LEDGES IN GRANBY RIVER VALLEY TO THE EAST.
NO ROCK KNOBS, NO GOOD HANGING VALLEYS.
AND THERE IS POSITIVE EVIDENCE POINTING TO THE SAME CONCLUSION.
THE MANY ROCK CUTS ALONG
THE KETTLE VALLEY R FROM THE WILKINSON CREEKLOOP NORTH TO COOKSON EXPOSE WEATHERED ROCK OVERLAIN
BY FRESH GRACIAL TILL.
BOTH ACIDIC AND BASIC IGNEOUS ROCK BE## INVOLVED AND BOTH WEATHERED.
A DIKE OF GREENSTONE IN ONE CUT IS DECOMPOSED TO AN INCOHERENT MASS TO A DEPTH OF 10 FEET AND ONLY
THE CORES OF THE JOINT BLOCKS BELOW THAT DEPTH TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT (15 FT.) SHOW THE GREENISH
BLACK COLOR OF THE ORIGNAL ROCK.
IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT GLACIAL EROSION HAS NOT OCCURRED
ON THESE VALLEY SLOPES DURING WISCONSIN TIMES, NOR PROBABLY DURING SPOKANE TIMES, IF EVER AT ALL.
NOW, WITH THIS ESTABLISHED, IT IS OF GREAT NTEREST TO NOTE THAT THE KETTLE VALLEY ABOVE LOIS
STATION CONTAINS MAGNIFICENT SIDE HILL GASHES OF TREMENDOUS SIZE.
IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT WHATEVER
MADE THESE SIDEHILL GASHES WAS NOT GLACIAL EROSION.
THE KETTLE VALLEY RR MAKES A LONG LOOP BACK UP WILKINSON CREEK IN ORDER TO PASS THRU THE
ARLINGTON LAKES VALLEY AT LAKEVALE STATION.
THE LAKES VALLEY IS PARALLEL WITH THE KETTLE RIVER
VALLEY, IS ABOUT 6 MILES LONG ASID OPENS INTO THE KETTLE VALLEY AT BOTH ENDS.
ITS FLOOR IS Two
ADO TOR THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE FLOOR OF KETTLE VALLEY AND THE RIDGE OF ROCK WHICH SEPARATES THE
Beavandey жао
Two Is 100° R
600 FERT HIGHER THAN THE LAKES VALLEY.
MOREOVER, THE LAKES VALLEY IS VERY
NARROW AND HAS STEEP SLOPES WITH RATHER PROMINENT ROCK LEDGES, WHILE KETTLE VALLEY SLOPES
ARE GENTLER AND ARE SOIL-COVERED ALMOST EVERYWHERE.
IN OTHER WORDS, ARLINGTON LAKES VALLEY IS A SIDE HILL GASH.
IT ALSO HAS MINOR LATERAL
RIDGES AND GASHES ON ITS SLOPES, PLENTY OF THEM.
THE COMMON OCCURRENCE OF ROCK ESPOSURES ON THE
SIDES OF THE LAKES GASH AND ON THE SECONDARY RIDGES OF THOSE SIDES, AND THE FRESH- LOOKING BLOCKY
TALUS SEEMS TO INDICATE MUCH LESS WEATBERIN@OF THE SIDE-HILL GASH SLOPES THAN OF THE PREGLACIAL
SLOPES OF KETTLE RIVER VALLEY.
THIS POINT, HOWEVER, WAS NOT FULLY APPRECIATED WHEN IN THE


181
FIELD TODAY AND MUST BE RE-EXAMINED.
THERE ARE MANY SMALLER GASHES AND RIDGES IN THE FORESTED SLOPES OF KETTLE VALLEY HERE.
ONE WAS NOTED BY REINECKE WHO ALSO MENTIONS "SMALL DRY DRAWS™ ON THE HILLSIDES OF HALL CREEK
VALLEY THAT "LOOK As THO THEY HAD BEEN PARTLY SLIOED OUT OF THE HILLSIDER
HALL CREEK IS ANO
THER NAME FOR ARLING CREEK, THE OUTLET OF ARLINGTON LAKES.
SINCE THE LAKES LIE AT THE NORTH
END OF THEIR VALLEY, THE STREAMBRAINS SOUTHWARD THRUOUT MOST OF THE LENGTH OF THE VALLEY.
THE ARLINGTON LAKES GASH WAS NOT APPRECIATED BY REINECKE AS A GIANT EXAMPLE OF A DRAW WHICH
LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN PARTLY SLOBED OUT OF THE ALL$/dE/ MOUNTAINSIDE.
BUT IT CLEARLY IS.
ONE WALKS NORTH FROM THE LAKES ALONG THE R,A FEW TENS OF FEET ABOVE THEIR SURFACE, AND FINDS/
THE VALLEY ABRUPTLY OPENING OUT AT FULL WIDTH INTO THE KETTLE, THE FLOOR OF WHICH 1548 hAmat
LEAST BELOW.
SUCH A VALLEY IS NO PRODUCT OF ANY TRIBUTARY STREAM
AND SURELY NOT OF GLACIAL
$/#// EROSION WHEN THE EVIDENCE OF THE ROCK CUTS IN WEATHERED MATERIAL FOR THE NEXT SIX MILES TO
COOKSON IS CONSIDERED.
IT MUST BE THE PRODUCT OF A GREAT STREAM FLOWING WHEN GLACIAL ICE WAS
PRESENT.
ARLINGTON LAKES VALLEY IS NOT APPARENT AS A SIDE HILL GASH, BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE AND THE FACT
THAT THE OBSERVER TRAVELS IN IT, ALONG THE R WHICH IS THE ONLY ROUTE THRU HERE.
PERHAPS IF IT
COULD BE VIEWED BROM THE EAST SIDE OF THE KETTLE VALLEY, ITS CHARACTER WOUDD BE MORE APPARENT.
SUCH A GASH ON THE EAST SIDE SHOULD BE OL#EARLY INTERPRETABLE FROM THE WEST SIDE.
NOW, SUCH A GASH DOES EXIST!!
IT IS TRULY SPECTACULAR, ALSO.
IT EXTENDS FOR ABOUT FOUR
MILES ALONG THE EAST WALL, COOKSON BEING APPOSITE ITS NORTHERN ART.
ITS ORIENTATION IS
SUCH THAT IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS A NORTHWARD EXTESSION OF THE LAKES GASH, CROSSING THE RIVER
IN THE AIR BETWEEN ITS SOUTHERN END AND THE LAKE GASHES NORTHERN END,
THIS EAST WALL SIDE HILL GASH OCCUPIES FULLY A THIRD OF THE WHOLE PREGLACIAL SLOPE FROM
MT SUMMIT TO VALLEY BOTTOM, PERHAPS A HALF.
PHOTO PERHAPS WILL SHOW PROPORTIONS.
qui
IT IS SEVERAL AUTORES TWiN EEP ON ITS EASTERN WALL AND PROBABLY ALL OF 200 FEET DEEP ON ITS DOWN-
HILL SIDE.
IT CROSSES THREE PREGLACIAL RAINED GOOVES WHICH DESCENDED TO THE KETTLE, SO THAT
THE SEPARATING RIDGE BETWEEN IT AND THE KETTLE HAS AN UNDULATORY CREST, THE LOW PLACES BEING THE
TRUNCATED GROOVES.
A SHORTER SECONDARY RIDGE CAN BE SEEN ON THE EASTERN WALL.
ALL WALLS ArE
CLIFFED AND MUCH TALUS HAS ACCUMULATED IN THE GASH.
NO OTHER SLOPES ON THIS VALLEY SIDE ARE
CLIFFED.
THIS TRULY SPECTACULAR LAND FORM IS NOT ALON ON THE EAST WALL OPPOSITE COOKSON.
THERE IS
ANOTHER SHARPLY MARKED INCISION ACROSS A SPUR JUST WEST OF THE HEAD OF THIS EASTERN GASH.
IT
LOOKS TO BE NEARLY A MILE WIDE AT THE TOP AND ITS SLOPES ARE VERY STEEP.
IT IS A NOTCH RATHER
THAN A LATERAL GASH, BUT IT CLEARLY BELONGS TO THE SAME CATEGORY.
SUSANTOSE
TIS A

HERE COMES NOW THE STATEMENT OF THE GREAT FIND (PERHAPS).
IN THE BOTTOM OF KETTLE VALLEY
AT COOKSON IS A VALLEY BASALT FLOW ! !
IT IS ABOUT 150 FEET BELOW HE R AND THE STREAM HAS
TRENCHED PERHAPS 75 FEET INTO IT.
ITS SURFACE APPEARS LEVEL, ITS CLIFFS SHOW COLUMNAR STRUCTURE
AND THE GREAT TALUS ACOUMULATION SEEMS ATRIBUTABLE TO FRACTURING OF THESE COLUMNS. THE COUNTRY
ROCK HERE IS METAMORPHOSED GRANITE, CHIEFLY, WITH SHEETING, SHEARING AND A FEW META-INTRUSIONS.
THIS HORIZONTAL SHEET OF BASALT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE COUNTRY ROCK SERIES, OUTCROPPING HERE
BECAUSE OF STREAM EROSION.
THE BASALT IS VESICULAR OR SCORIAGEOUS, CAVITIES UNFILLED, COLUMNS
VERTICAL.
IT IS CONFIDENTLYACCEPTED AS THE SOUTHERMOST TONGUE OF THE PLEISTOCENE BASALT FLOWS
WHICH ARE ANTICIPATED IN THE HIGHLAND TO THE NORTH, BETWEEN HEDWATERS OF THE VARIOUS KETTLE FORKS
VALLEYS //** MA/A/ AND THE VALLEY WHICH DRAINS WESTWARD TO THE OKANOGAN VALLEY AT VERNON.
THERE WAS TOO LITTLE TIME TO EXAMINETHIS FLOW AND DETERMINE ITS EXTENT. IT QUITE SURELY DOES NOT
REACH MORE THAN A MILE OR TWO SOUTH OF COOKSON.
ITS NORTHWARD EXTENT IS STILL TO BE TRACED.
WHAT FUN!
BEAVERDELL TO KELOWNA
Ave 2 1926
REVIEW OF FEATURES OF WEST FORK KETTLE VALLEY ABOUT AND BELOW WESTBRIDGE SHOWS PLENTY OF
STEEP CLIFFS WHICH SEEM TO BE THE PRODUCTS OF GLACIAL DEEPENING OR WIDENING.
ERIDENCE FOR
ACTUAL DEEPENING IS NOT GOOD, HOWEVER.
AND THE VICINITY OF ROCK CREEK CARRIES LARGE DRIFT
DEPOSITS ON THE MT. ELANX AND ONLY THE SHOULDERS AND KNOBS ARE NOTICEABLY GLACiATED. VALLEYS
OF ROCK CREEK AND BAKER (?) OREEK ALONG HIGHWAY WEST TO OSOOYOS, CARRY MUCH DRIFT IN TERRACES AND
MORAINIC PILES ON THE NORTH WALLS.
STREAMS ARE BOTH CLOSER. TO SOUTH WALL AS THO THE ORIGINAL
DEPOSIT WAS LARGELY MADE ON THE NORTH SIDE.
ROAD DOWN TO OSOYOOS LAKE PASSES THRU OR CLOSE BY A NUMBER OF SIDE-HILL GASHES OR NOTCHES
THAT ARE VERY MARKED.
BUT THEY ARE SO NUMEROUS AND SHARP PERS ON MT. SLOPES OF SHOULDERS
ARE
SO COMMON ALL ALONG THIS VALLEY NORTH TO OKANOGAN LAKE THAT IT SEEMS UNSAFE TO INTERPRET THEM ALL
AS PRODUCED BY SUBGLACIAL STREAMS.
SOME ARE GREAT MTS. STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BROAD
OKANOGAN VALLEY ARE ARE SURELY NOT OFTHIS GENESIS.
OTHERS, LIKE THE ONE NORTH OF PEACHLAND
AND THE ONE WEST OF DOG LAKE, LOOK LIKE GREAT SIDE-HILL GASHES.
THEY ARE MUCH LONGER THAN THE
NOTCHES BACK OF THE PINNACLES ON THE SLOPE DOWN TO OSOYOOS LAKE.
MORAINE BETWEEN VASEAUX LAKE AND DOG LAKE_ IS 300 FT ABOVE VASEAUX.
DOG LAKE. IS 140 FT
ABONEVASEAUX LAKE.
THE RIVER HAS CUT DOWN THRU THE MORAINE TO THE ROCK SHOULDER OR BARRIER AT
OKANOGAN FALLS.
THE WIDTH OF THE MORAINE IS THE DISTANOE BETWEEN THE TWO LAKES.
THIS MORAINE
MARKS A PAUSE IN THE RETREAT JUST BEFORE THE EPISODE OFOEPOSITION OF THE SILTS MARGINING DOG
AND OKAnOGAN LAKES.
KELOWNA TO MCCULLOCH
AUGUST 3 1926
THE CHIEF SILT TERRACE EAST OF KELOWNA IS 300 FT ABOVE THE LAKE, OR 1430 A.T.
AND IT IS
AS THICK AS IT IS HIGH FOR SILT IS WELL EXBOSED FROM BOTTOM TO TOP.
IF SILT WERE DEPOSITED AS
DAWSON AND PARDEE ARGUE, THE BIG MORAINE BETWEEN VASEAUX AND DOG LAKES WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBMERGED
AND WOULD CARRY SILT.
THERE ISNT A SUGGESTION OF SILT TERRACES ON THIS MORAINE, NOR OF ANY-
THING BUT THE MEREST BEGINNING OF EROSION ON IT.
THE MORAINE WHERE CROSSED BY THE HIWAY IS
160 FEET ABOVE DOG LAKE OR 1276 Y.A.T.
THIS MORAINE THEREFORE WAS NOT THE DAM FOR THE LOCAL


183
LAKE OR LAKES IN WHICH THE EXTBNSIVE SILTS OF OKANOGAN LAKE WERE DEPOSITED. THERE IS THEREFORE
NO OTHER INTERPRETATION THAN THAT OF NARROW MARGINAL WATER BODIES, NOTALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN
CONNECTED, LYING BETWEEN A SHRINKING ICE TONGUE AND THE WALLEY WALLS.
IT IS A PUZZLE WHY THESE
LAKES, SO CLOSE TO ICE AND TO ROCK, SHOULD HAVE SUCH WELL-SORTED SILT, WITHOUT SAND OR GRAVEL ORR
STRAY COBBLES AND BLDRS THRU MANY FEET OF THICKNESS.
THE TILL IN THIS VALLEY (AND ELSEWHERE
IN THE PART OF B.C. STUDIED) IS VERY LIGHT COLORED AND HAS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SILTY TEXTURED
MATERIAL. SLACKWATER MAKES MUST HAVE BEEN FILLED RAPIDLY WITH THIS.
COUNT THE VARVES AND
SEE IF "RAPIDLY" IS CORRECT.
OTHER TERRACES OF SILT OCCUR UP MISSION CREEK ALONG THE ROAD TO M-CULLOCH.
A VERY PROMI-
NENT TERRACE OF SILT, WITHOUT GRAVEL ON TOP, LIES AT 2200 (2300?)
IT IS 200 FT THICK.
THE
UPPER PART IS CLEAR SILT, THE LOWER PART HAS PEBBLES AND COBBLES, SOME OF THEM STRIATED, SO ABUND-
ANTLY DISTRIBUTED THAT THE DEPOSIT LOOKS MUCH LIKE TILL.
IT STRATId/APA//FICATION HOWEVER
IDENTIFIES IT AS SIET. ITS ALTITUDE IS WAY ABOVE PARDEE'S UPPER LIMIT FOR THE NESPELEM FORMATION
AND NOTHING BY COE COULD HAVE HELD IT BACK IN THIS VALLEY DURING DEPOSITION.
FURTHERMORE, THERE IS A PROMINENT WIDE TERRACE OF GRAVEL EAST OF KELOWNA AT 500 FT+ ABOVE THE
LAKE.
IN ONE PIT ALONG THE ROAD, VERY FINE FORESET BEDS ARE EXPOSED, DIPPING TOWARD THE LAKE.
THE MAIN SILT TERRACE IS BELOW (IN ALTITUDE AND THE MISSION CREEK SILT TERRACE IS ABOVE (HIGHER)
AND FOUR OR FIVE MILES FARTHER AWAY FROM THE LAKE.
THESE FACTS CANNOT BE HARMONIZED BY THE
GENERAL SUBMERGENCE HYROTHESIS OF DAWSON AND PARDEE.
IN THE VICINITY OF MCCULLOCH IS AN EXTENSIVE BASALT PLATEAU-LIKE UPLAND, WHOSE ALTITUDE IS
4000 то 4200.
IT IS THE LONG SOUGHT LAVA FLOW, THE CAUSE OF THE SPOKANE FLOOD! PERHAPS!!
THE BASALT IS EXPOSED IN THREE RAILROAD CUTS SOUTH OF MCCULLOCH FROM ONE TO TWO MILES.
IT IS VERY RUDELY COLUMNAR WITH HUGE JOINT-DETERMINED FRAGMENTS. ITS CDOOR IS BLUE BLACK TO
PINKISH BLACK.
ITS VESICULARITY IS IN HORIZONTAL BANDS OR ZONES OF BUBBLES AND ALSO IN VERTICAL
STRINGS OR PIPES OF BUBBLES.
THESE ARE VERY XOONS MARKED IN SOME PLACES.
SOME OF THE HOR-
IZONTAL SEAMS OF BUBBLESARE VERY NARROW, HARDLY TWO INCHES IN BIDTH. SOMEWHAT UNDULATORY BUT
REMARKABLY CONTINUOUS.
I HAVE NEVER BEFORE SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THEM.
IS
THE PLATEAU, TRAVERSED BY THE ROAD TO MCCULLOCH FOR PERHAPS THREE MILES.
ABOUT THE STATION,
IT IS FAIRLY WELL SHOWN BY RESSON OF THE RAILROAD CLERRING, A RANCH CLEARING AND THE KELOWNA
IRRIGATION RESERVOIR CLEARINGS.
THE SURFACE OF THE PLATEAU IS UNDULATORY, SOME OF THE RELIEF
DUE TO EROSION, SOME PERHAPS TO ORIGINAL PROFILES OF THE FLOWS.
IN PARTICULAR, THREE SYMMETR-
ICAL, LOW CONICAL HILLS EAST OF THE STATION APPEAR LIKE THE LAVA CONES OF THE SNAKE RIVER LAVA
PLAINS AND NOT LIKE THE SUMMITS OF PARTIALLY SUBMERGED MTS. (STEPTOES) BUT THE COUNTRY IS SO
DENSELY FORESTED THAF AGGOOD IDEA OF THE CHARACTER OF THE PLATEAU HERE IS DIFFiCULT TO OBTAIN.
THE POOR DRAINAGE OF THE PLATEAU AT THE SUMMIT IS NO WORTHY.
THE IRRIGATION RESERVOIR
DISCHARGES NORTHWARD TO HYDRAULIC OR CAMON CREEK BUT THE OVBRELOW DISCHARGES TO KETTLE RIVER.
AT LEAST THREE DAMS HAVE BEEN CONSTUCTED TO HOLD THIS WATER IN.
A LAKE ALSO LIES HERE, A
LITTLE HIGHER PERHAPS THAN THE RESERVOIR. OTHER LAKES IN THE VICINITY ARE SHOWN ON THE MAPS.
THE PLATEAU HAS BEEN GLACIATED. FRESH WISCONSIN TILL IS 30 FEET THICK OR MORE AT THE
NORTH END OF THE RESERVOIR.
EAST OF THE LAKE ALONG THE RAILROAD, THE SURFACE OF THE BASALT IS
BARE AND CARRIES WEATHERED GLACIAL GROOVINGS WHICH STRIKE ABOUT S 20°E.
THERE ARE NO NEARBY
ELEVATIONS TO INFLUENCE THE COURSE OF THE ICE HERE.
TILL TO LEE (S) OF THESE HIGHER SURFACES


OF BASALT. IS FULL OF HUGE BOULDERS OF BASALT, &S MUCH AS 8 FT. IN MAX. DAAMETER, AND STRIKINGLY
STRIATED THO THEY HAVE BEEN CARRIED ONLY A FEW HUNDRED FEET GROM THEIR SOURCE.
BASE OF THE BASALT NOT FOUND. IT MUST BE FOUND AND ITS RELATIONS TO UNDERLYING SURFACES S
DETERMINED IF IT IS TO BE ESTABLISHED AS PLEISTOCENE IN AGE.
A HILL OF REMARKABLY THIN, REMARKABLY REGULAR LAVA FLOWS, WITH UNDFORM COLUMNS FROM BOTTOM
TO TOP, ALONG NORTH SIDE OF MISSION CREEK ABOUT HALF WAY BETWEEN MOCULLOCH AND KELOWNA.
IT IS
MUCH LOWER THAN THIS PLATEAU BASALT, AND DOUBTLESS THE HILL WHOM THEY GONSTITUTE: IS PREGLACIAL
"IN ORIGIN.
NOT YET TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE SAME BASALT.
FLOWS CONSIDERABLY WARPED OR BENT
IN PLACES.
WHY SHOULD THIS PLATEAU BASALT CEASE SO ABRUPTLY TOWARD THE DEEP CAN OX OKANOGAN VALLEY?
IT IS HALF A MILE ABOVE THE LAKE AND THE BESCENT THENCE IS FAP STEEPER THAN THAT DOWN THE KETTLE
TO THE SOUTH. THE YOUTHFULNESS OF THE PLATEAU IS SO MARKED THAT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCRIBE
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WIDE OKANOGAN VALLEY WITH ITS GROUPS OF SOLATED HILLS AND SINGLE ISOLATED
HILLS TO POST-BASALT TIME. JUST AS IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONSIDER THE KETTLE VALLEY TO THE
SOUTH AS YOUNGER THAN THE BASALT. WAR
FROM KELOWnA UP MISSION CREEK
AUGUST 4 1926
PURPLE MT AT THE HEAD OF JOE RICH CREEK WAS CLIMBED TO ABOUT 4700
NO BASALT IN IT- NO
BASALT IN SIGHT- NO PLATEAU IN SIGHT.
MT. PTARMIGAN (BIG WHITE MT) EAST OF COOKSON AND WEST
OF DAMFIN® CREEK RISES AT LEAST 2000 FTABOVE PURPLE MT'S SOUTHERN PROMONTORY AND APPEARS HEAVILY
GLACIATED, FOR RUBBED ROCK LEDGES ARE PLAINLY VISIBLE AND THE SUMMIT AND SLOPES ARE ROUNDED.
MT. PTARMIGAN APPEARS TO BE A MONADNOCK ON THE INTERIOR PLATEAU PEEPLAIN. SUMMIT OF PURPLE
MT, AT THE SOUTH END AT LEAST, IS VERY GREATLY ABRADED BY ICE, VERY LARGE/GROOVES AND RIDGES
RECORDING THE EROSION.
GROOVES ARE 20-30 FEETODEEP. SCATTERED ERRATIC MATERIAL ON TOP.
WHERE IS THE BASALT PLATEAU WHICHIS NECESSARY FOR THE SUBGLACIAL VULCANISM HYPOTHESIS?
IF IT EXISTS, IT CAN ONLY BE TO THE EAST OF PURPLE MT. AND IN THE HEADWATERS OF KETTLE AND DAMFINO
STREAMS.
THIS IS AN ALMOST INACCESSIBLE COUNTRY!
IT SHOULD BE APPROACHED, APPARENTLY, FROM
THE VERNON-EDGEWOOD ROAD, BY WAY OF DAWSONS BASALT ON THE SHUSWAP SHEET.
AS SEEN FROM THE TOP OF PURPLE MT., THE WHOLE REGION IS A DISSECTED RUGGED PLATEAU TRACT, WITH
ONLY PTARMIGAN AS REAL MOUNTAINOUS TOPOGRAPHY AND ALTITUDE.

THERE ALL THE SUMMER. THERE IS NO SIGN FROM TOP OF PURPLE OF THE GREAT OKANOGAN VALLEY ABOUT KELOWNA.
BLACK KNÖGHT MN., WHICH STANDS UP SO STRIKINGLY ABOVE THE VALLEY, IS ONLY THE WESTERN MARGIN OF
THE DISSECTED PLATEAU.
WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THIS WIDE VALLEY? IT APPARENTLY HAS A NUMBER
OF LOWER ERODED HILLS IN IT, ASTRHO IT WERE AN OLD LOWLAND OF THE PREGLACIAL STREAM SYSTEM. YET
IT MAY BE STRUCTURAL FOR IT IS FAR WIDER THAN THE VASEAUX LAKE PART OF THE VALLEY.
YET AGAIN
VASEAUX MAY MARK THE PREGLACIAL DIVIDE REGION, THE OKANOGAN THEN DRAINING NORTHWARD.
MORAINIC TOPOGRAPHY ON THE SOUTH SLOPE OF BLACK KNIGHT MT IS STRIKINGLY DEVELOPED.
I HAVE
NEVER SEEN MORE SHARPLY ACCENTED HILLS OF TILL. THEY ARE VERY IRREGULAR, VERY STEEP-SIDED.
INDIVIDUAL HILLS ARE 50 TO 75 FEET HIGH. UNDRAINED DEPRESSIONS ARE OOMMON.
THEY RANGE ALONG
THE MT. SLOPE THRU NEARLY 1000 FT OF ALTITUDE.
THE GREAT SIDE HILL CANYON SEEN EAST OF COOKSON OPENS OUT TO THE NORTH THRU A LONG WESTERN
SPUR OF PTARMIGAN MT.
IT IS REPORTED TO BE WITHOUT A STREAM THO WHERE THE LONG NORTHEASTERN
TRIB TO WEST FORK OF KETTLE GOES IN THAT CASE IS A PUZZLE.
PERHAPS THE GASH SEEN TO THE SOUTH


185
FROM PURPLE MT. ISNT THE REMARKABLE SIDEHILL GASH BUT IS THE EQUALLY DEEP NOTCH JUST WEST OF THE
LONG GASH.
338 TON
AT ANY RATE, THE CANYON SEEN FROM PURPLE MT IS OUT OF HARMONY WITH ALL THE REST OF THE
TOPOGRAPHY.
THE COUNTRY NORTH OF PTARMIGAN SEEMS TO BE WITHOUT SHARPLY CUT VALLEYS, YET THE
DRAINAGE GOES SOUTHWARD, EITHER THRU THE GASH OR THE NOTCH.
FURTHER, THIS COUNTRY NORTH OF
PTARMIGAN IS LARGELY LOWER THAN THE SPUR THRU WHICH THE GASH AND NOTCH ARE CUT.
IT IS ALL VERY
CURIOUS.
BASALT REPORTED AT MYRA IN R CUT, THIS MUST BE SEEN, WHAT ARE ITS RELATIONS TO THE BASALT
FLOWS AT MCCULLOCH?
WARDWELL OR WARDLOW, THE RANCHER AT MOCULLOCK SAYS MUCH OF THE COUNTRY
WEST OF MOCULLOCH IS KK% LIKE THAT ABOUT THE STATION- WITHOUG GREAT RELIEF- A PART, PRESUMABLY,
OF THE LAVA PLATEAU.
BUT THIS DISTRICT IS TOO SMALL TO HAVE FUNCTIONED AS A CARSE FOR THE
SPOKANE FLOOD.
THERE MUST BE MORE TO THE EAST AND THE NORTHEAST, OR THE GASH AND THE NOTCH
EAST OF COOKSON AND THE ARLINGTON LAKES VALLEY ARE WITHOUT SUPPORT AS PRODUCTS OF SUBGLACIAL
VUCCANISM AND IF THEY ARE NOT, THEN NO GASHES OR NOTCHES CAN BE OF THIS GENESIS.
VERNON TO CHERRYVILLE
AUG. 6 1826
THE THRU VALLEY BETWEEN THE OKANOGAN AND SHUSWAP VALLEYS IS BETWEEN 1700 AND 1800.
ALT.
OF SURFACE OF LONG LAKE (WOOD LAKE) IS 1293 AND ALTITUDE OF SHONAP RIVER AT JCT OF BESSETTE CR.
Is 1500.
ThE DIVIDE IS 8 MILES FROM LONG LAKE AND ABOUT 12 FROM THE SHOSWAP. THE THRU
VALLEY SEEMS BUT LITTLE MODIFIED ROM PREGLACIAL PROPORTIONS EXCEPT NEAR THE WEST END WHERE THERE
ARE SEVERAL ROCK HILLS IN IT, THE LARGEST OF WHICH IS 1000 FT ABOVE LoNG LAKE.
ONE OF THESE
HILLS LIES SO CLOSE TO THE SOUTH WALL AND SS SO ELONGATED PARALLEL TO THE MT WALL THAR IT SHOULD
BE CLASSIFIED AS A SIDE HILL GASH.
TWO SMALL LAKES IN IT ALSO.
THESE ROCK KNOBS AND HILLS APPEAR TO BE OF THE SAME GENESS AS THOSE IN THE GLACIALLY DEEPEN-
LONG
ED VALLEYS ALREADY EXAMINED. I6 THIS BE THE CASE, THE LAKE AND OKANOGAN LAKE BASINS HAVE
BEEN GLACIALLY ERODED INTO THE BEDROCK BELOW PREGLACIAL PROFILES.
COLDSTREAM VALLEY AND
BESSETTE CREEK VALLEY HAVE TRUNCATED SPURS AND FAIRLY WELL ALIGNED SIDES BUT NO HANGING VALLEYS
WERE OBSERVED.
THE CREIGHTON VALLEY- ECHO LAKE VALLEY, SOUTH OF CAMELS HUMP AD ITS ASSOCIATED HILLS/ TO THE
EAST, IS A REMARKABLY NARROW, DEEP, STEEP- WALLED CANYON WHICH IS NOR PARTLY BLOCKED BY DRIFT TO
FORM THE LAKE BASINS.
ITS CLOSE PARALLELISM WITH THE VALLEY NORTH OF CAMELS HUMP RANGE OF HILLS
IS CURIOUS, AND ITS NARROWNESS AND LOW GRADEENT ARE OUT OF HARMONY WITH THE OTHER LOW GRADIENT
VALLEYS OF THE REGION.
IT IS MORE LIKELY THE VALLEYS OF HARRY CREEK, DUTEAU CREEK, ETC., WHICH
DESCEND As MUCH AS 3000 FEET IN THE DISTANCE THAT COEIGHTON CREEK DESCENDS LESS THAN 1000 FEET.
AS UNUSUAL AS CREIGHTON CREEK ALLEY IS THE CAMELS HUMP RIDGE WHICH BLOCKS IT OFF FROM THE
SHUSWAP.
CAMELS HUMP IS A STARTLINGLY STEEP-WALLED MONOLITH, WHICH STIOKS UP MOST CONSPICUOUS-
LY ABOVE ITS SURROUNDINGS.
IT SUGGESTS DEVILS TOWER, AsSSEEN FrOM THe WEsT.
IT IS COMPOSED OF
A LAVA WHICH IS, OR WHICH WEATHERS, ALMOST WHITE.
COLUMNAR STRUCTURE IS PRESENT, THO POORLY
DEVELOPED.
THE TOPOGRAPHY. SHOWS STEEP SLOPES AND CONSIDERABLE CLIFFING EVERYWHERE IN THE
AREAS WHICH DAWSON MAPS As MIOCENE BASALT.
WHATERER THE CORRECTNESS OR INCORRECTNESS OF
DAWSON'S DETERMINATION OF THIS LAVA AS BASALT, IT CERTAINLY IS A GEOLOGICALLY LATE EFFUSION, BUT
IT ALSO HAS BEEN GREATLY ERODED FOR CREIGHTON CREEK VALLEY CUTS IT AND THE EMPTY VALLEY CONNECTING
BESSETTE CREEK AND SHUSWAP RVVER CROSSES IT.
GLACIAL EROSION WAS SEVERE IN THE SHUSWAP NORTH-

VICINITY OF ABERDEEN LAKE
AUG. 7 1926
THE UPLAND SOUTH OF COLDSTREAN-BESSETTE VALLEY, AND EAST OF OKANOGAN VALLEY IS AN UNDULATING
PLATEAU ABOVE 4000 AND WITH BUT LITTLE OF IT EXCEPT THE BROAD BUCK HILLS #фф DOME ABOVE 5000
ONLY A FEW VALLEYS ARE TRENCHED INTO IT AND THESE ARE PREVAILINGLY YOUTHFUL.
MaNY LakeS ON
IT AND MANY HILLS THAT ARE ROUGHLY CIRCULAR IN OUTLINE.
ONE OF THESE HILLS WAS CLIMBED.
IT IS
JUST WEST OF THE ROAD TO ABERDEEN LAKE, IN THE LATITUDE OF THE NORTH END OF THE LAKE.
IT IS A
BASALT HILL ABOUT 400 FEET ABOVE THE HIGHEST SURROUNDING LAND. A ITS SLOPES ARE VERY STEEP, IN
PLACES CLIFFED, AND ARE COVERED WITH LARGE BLORS OF BASALT, WITH HERE AND THERE AN ERRATIC COBBLE
OR BLDR.
ITS SUMMIT IS 500-600 FEET ACROSS AND STRONGLY GLACIATED. THE HILL IS ABOUT A MILE ACROSS
AT THE BASE.
IT IS QUITE OUT OF HARMONY WITH THE SURROUNDING SLOPES.
BLORS AND COBBLES, BUT
LITTLE WORN THO GLACIATED, ARE STREWN ALL ALONG THE ROAD ON THE EAST SiDE AND SOUTH TO THE SOUTH
END OF ABERDEN LAKE NORTH OF THE HILL, THE DIRT IS EOTALLY LACKING IN BASALT.
THE BASALT IS DENSE AND VERY FINE-GRAINED, BLACK TO BLUE-BLACK WHERE UNWEATHERED, GRAY ON
WEATHERED SURFACES. VERY LITTLE SCORIACEOUS TEXTURE SEEN.
YET WITH ALL THE LACK OF SCORIACEOUSNESS, THIS CONICAL HILL IS HERE INTERPRETED AS A LAVA CONE,
IT STANDS ON A BASEMENT OF THE SHUSWAP GRANITE AND GNEISS WHICH IS EXPOSED IN LEDGES BOTH NORTH
AND SOUTH OF THE BUTTE. THE LAKE BASIN WHICH IS BETWEEN 4200 AND 4300 IN ALTITUDE, IS IN THE
SHUSWAP GNEISS.
IF THIS HILL IS NOT A LOCAL CONE, IT MUST BE A REMNANT DEFT IN THE EROSION OF
A COMPLETE 66//K BASALT LAVA FLOW COVER OF THE PLATEAU.
THIS ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION
HAS MANY OBJECTIONS TO IT. ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE RESTRICTIONS IS THE QUERY WHY EXTENSIVE
BLOWS OF SUCH TOPOGRAPHIC RECENCY SHOULD NOT HAVE BUN DOWN THE VALLEY SLOPES, EVEN IF POORED
OUT FROM VENTS IN THE UPLAND WHICH AVERAGES HALF A MILE ABOVE THE GREAT ADJACENT VALLEYS.
IS THE VOLCANIC FIELD FOR WHICH I AM LOOKING TO TURN OUT TO BE A PATCHY GROUP OF LITTLE
CONES AND LITTLE FLOWS?
IS IT ALL GOING TO BE ON UPLANDS WHERE THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF CANYON
ING TO SHOW THE BASE OF THE BASALT?
IS IT GOING TO BE ON UPLANDS WHERE THE ICE WASTHIN AND
CONSEQUENTLY THE AMOUNT OF WATER VIELDED BY THE SUBGLACIAL MELTING WAS AT A MINIMUM?
SILT UP CREIGHTON CREEK VALLEY IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY BUT NO TERRACE FORMS RECOGNIZED.
ALSO IN STREAMLESS VALLEY BETWEEN BESSETTE CR. AND SHUSWAP RIVER.
VERNON TO KETTLE RIVER ON EDGEWOOD ROAD
AUG. 7 1926
THE PASS USED BY THE ROAD FROM MONASHEE CREEK TO KETTLE RIVER DRAINAGE IS A DEEP, STEEP-WALLE
ED, NARROW VALLEY.
LAKES AND SWAMPS AND MEADOWS AT THE PASS.
HEAVY DRIFT UNIFORMLY
SPREAD, LTTTLE BEDROCK SHOWING AND NO DRIFT FORMS.
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS VALLEY, A
LITTLE SOUTH OF THE DWVISE, STANDS A NARROW BLADE-LIKE ROCK HILL, PERHAPS 75 FEET HIGH AND WiTH
WATER STANDING OR FLOWING ON BOTH SIDES.
IT IS A VERY PECULIAR FORM FOR GLACIAL EROSION TO
PRODUCE AND IF IT WERE IN THE PROPER LOCATION, IT MIGHT WELL BE ASCRIBED TO SUBGLACIAL STREAM
ACTION IN THE PASS.
BUT THE LOCATION SEEMS TO BE WRONG IF THE VOLCANIC FIELD IS ON THE
ABERDEEN/ IDEAL UPLAND.
IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE, HOWEVER, OF WATER MOVING NORTHWARD FROM THE


187
AREA OF MELTING BENEATH THE ICE, BOYING IT, BEING UNDER GREAD PRESSURE, AND ESCAPING SOWTHWARD
TO THE KETTLE BY THIS ROUTE AS WELL AS GOING OUT BY WAY OF LONG LAKE AND OKANOGAN LAKE.
GRANITE OF THE MS HERE BENEATH THE BRIFT IS PRETTY MUCH DECOMPOSED, THO NOT REDDEDED.
THE
DRIFT IS FRESH WISCONS IN MATEBIAL.
THE SITUATION SEEMS PARALLELED BY THAT IN THE UPPER KETTLE
WEST FORK BETWEEN LAKEVALLE AND COOKSON.
SOUTH-DRAINING VALLEYS A SHORT DISTANCE SOUTH OF T
THEIR DIVIDES SEEM TO ESCAPE THE GLACIAL EROSION THAT IS IN EIDENCE ELSEWHERE.
THE PASS AT THE HEAD OF MONASHEE CREEK. IS 4000, wHICH I$ 250 FEET A/ LOWER THAN KETTLE RIVER
WHERE CROSSED BY THE HIWAY/ FARTHER SOUTH/AMdEAST, TEN MILES SOUTH OF ITS HEAD. DOES THIS BEAR
ON THE PROBLEM OF THE ORIGIN OF THE BLADE-LIKE HILL IN THE PASS?
NO UNMETAMORPHOSED BASALT COBBLES FOUND IN THE GRAVELS OF KETTLE OR MON&SHEE WHERE ACCESSIBLE
RROM THE HIWAY.
NOR IN DRIFT EXPOSED ROAD CUTS. NOR IN BEDROCK WHERE SHOWN ALONG THE ROUTE.
AND THE TOPOGRAPHY HERE IS THAT OF VALLEYS AND RIDGES, NOT OF UPLAND FLATS LIKE ABERDEEN| DEAL.
NO SUGGESTION THEREFORE, IN THE TOPOGRAPHY, OF GEOLOGICALLY RECENT BLOWS.
ThE LOW RIDGE BETWEEN
KETTLE RIVER AND THE TRIB OS KETTLE SOUTH FROM MON^SHEE DIVIDE IS 360 FEET ABOVE THE KETTLE AND
600 ABOVE THE MONASHEE DIVIDE PASS.
AND SLOPES ARE STEEP.
SILT DEPOSIT PÉ OPENED A MILE OUT OF VERNON ON LUMBY ROAD IS WELL STRATIFIED AND FROM THE
ROAD THERE APPEARS TO BE A FAIRLY CONSTANT ALTERNATION LIKE THE SUCCESSION IN VARVES. BUT
CLOSER EXAMINATION SHOWS THE SILT TO BE VERY SANDY IN PARTS AND TO HAVE PEBBLES SCATTERED THRU IT
TO
AT ALL HORIZONS.
IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED PRETTY NEAR
MELTING ICE AND TO HAVE HAD FAIR-
LY VIGOROUS CURRENTS IN THE POND DURING ITS DEPOSITION.
VERNON TO TRINITY HILLS AND SALMON ARM
SUNDAY AUGUST 8 1926
DAWSON'S GRANITIC BRECCIA ON TRINITY HILLS WAs FOUND REPRESENTED ABUNDANTLY IN THE DRIfT
NEAR BOBBIE BURNS P.O. (TRINITY VALLEY)
IT IS A THOROUGHLY INDURATED COARSE~-GRAINED ARKOSE
AND NOT TO BE ASCRIBED TO VOLCANIC ACTION OF ANY SORT.
COMPLETE PEBBLES OF UNWEATHERED GRANITE
FOUND IN THE DENSE, HARD, LIGHT-COLORED MATRIX.
LEDGES OF A FINE GRAINED BACK ROCK, PRESUMABLY BASALT, SEEN ALONG THE ROAD ON WEST FLANK OF
TRINITY HILLS.
IT IS INCONSPICUOUSLY AND MINUTELY BUT MOST SURELY SCHISTOSE, AND THEREFORE
NOT MIOCENE FOR IT ANTEDATES THE ORIGINAL MT-MAKING. FRAGMENTS OF A SCORIAGEOUS BASALT, BROWN-
IN AND GRAYISH (ESPECIALLY), FOUND IN THE DRIFT WEST OF TRINITY MAY HAVE COME FROM THE
TRINITY HILL GROUP BUT PROBABLY CAME FROM THE NORTH ALONG WITH OTHER ERRATICS.
THE TRINITY HILLS AND BOBBIE BURNS MT. ARE TOPOGRAPHICALLY OLD FORMS, WHiTTLED OUT LONG
BEFORE GLACIATION.
NOTHING HERE IN TOPOGRAPHY OR IN ROCK OR DRIFT TO SUGGEST PLEISTOCENE
VULCANISM.
IS THERE ANY HOPE OF RECONSTRUCTING THE PREGLACIAL DRAINAGE PATTERN OF B.O.? THE ICESHEET
WHICH OVERRODE VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING MUST HAVE CUT OUT MANY LOW PREGLACIAL BIDIDES, PERHAPS IN 8
SOME CASES TO MAKE DEEP VALLEYS.
THE CONSEQUENCE IS A PLEXUS OF ANASTOMOSING DEEP VALLEYS, WITH
STREAMS PURSUING MOST ANOMALOUS COURSES PROM ONE VALLEY TO ANOTHER, WND WITH THE HIGHLANDS PRETTY
WELL SEPARATED INTO ISOLATED GROUPS A FEW MILES IN DIAMETER.
SOME ARE MUCH ELONGATED, AS THE
RIDGE OF HILLS BETWEEN OKANOGAN LAKE AND DOG LAKE VALLEYS, OTHERS ARE CIRCULOID. NO KEY TO THE
PUZZLE SEEMS IN SIGHT WITHOUT MOST CAREFUL DETAINED STUDY.
DRIFT DEPOSITS IN THE THRU VALLEY BETWEEN ENDERBY AND SALMON ARM ARE INSTRUCTIVE. THERE IS


MUCH TRULY MORAINIC TOPOGRAPHY ON THE SURFACE OF THE VALLEY FILL AND NOT MUCH IN SIGHT ON THE
MT. SLOPES.
THE HILLS ARE KAMES, RATHER THAN TILL ACCUMULATIONS. EVERY ROAD CUT SHOWS
REMARKABLY DEVELOPED FOREST BEDDING, THE DIP VARYING CONSIDERABLY IN ANY ONE CUT. NO SYSTEM TO
THE DIRECTION OF DIP WAS OBSERVED, BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT ICE STOOD ADJACENT TO AND AS HIGH As
OR HIGHER THAN EACH KNOLL WHEN IT WAS BUILT.
DRIFT DEPOSITS IN THE THRU VALLEY BETWEEN GLENEMA AND THE HEAD OF OKANOGAN LAKE ALSO TELL AN
INTERESTING STORY.
AS BETWEEN ENDERBY AND SALMON ARM, THE BRIFT IS MORAINIC IN EXPRESSION, GRA-
VELLY IN COMPOSITION, AND LOCATED ON THE VALLEY FLOOR.
A LONG LINE OF SMALL LAKES LIES IN A
LINEAR VALLEY THAT IS BORDERED ON THE EAST BY GOOD DRIFT TERRACES, AND IN PART ALSO ON THE WEST.
THIS VALLEY IS NO STREAM-CUT AFAIR; IT IS A CAST OF AN ICE TONGUE.
ANOTHER GOOD CASE IS THAT OF THE NORTH END OF OKANOGAN LAKE AND THE ADAAGENT SWAN LAKE VALLEY
ICE STOOD IN THE OKANOGN VALLEY WHILE A BIG MORAINE WAS DEPOSITED ALONG THE EAST BEGE AND
OUTWASH MATERIAL WAS DEPOSITED EAST OF THIS. MUCH OF THE OUTWASH WAS SILT AND PROBABLY A LAKE,
RATHER THAN STREAMS, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GENTLY SLOPING PLAIN EAST OF THE MORAINE.

SWAN LAKE MAY BE CONSIDERED THE SURVIVOR OF THE PLEISTOCENE LAKE.
DAWSON'S BASALT OF THE MT. IDA GROUP IS A PLATY GREY BASIC ROCK WITH SOME SCORIACEOUS PHASES,
POORLY DEFINED FLOW SUCCESSION, AND ALMOST NO COLUMNAR STRUCTURE. ACCORDING TO DAWSON'S MAP,
IT MUST BE POST-VALLEY IN AGE, AND THE EXAMINATION TODAY FROM THE WALLEY OF SALMON RIVER SUPPORTS
THIS VIEW.
THE MT. IDA SUMMIT SEEMS PROBABLY THE SHARPENED ERODED CONE FROM WHCH THE FLOWS
CAME.
BUT THEY MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WITH THE WIDEH. OF THE VALLEY HERE AND IT SEEMS ALTOGETHER
LIKELY THAT THEY DID NOT FLOW FAR DOWN INTO IT, AND HAVE BEEN CLEANED OUT SINCE OR ELSE THAT THE
VALLEY THEY ORIGINALLY ENTERED HAPPENS TO COINCIDE WITH A PRESENT ONE. I.E. THE PREBASALT
VALLEY HAS BEEN RE-EXCAVATED.
THERE IS NO SUGGESTION OF THE MODIFICATION OF PRESENT TOPOGRAPHIC
FEATURES, OTHER THAN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROMINENT CLIFFS AND SUPPORT OF A VERY PROMINENT SUMMIT,
WELL ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE NEAR IT. IS IT PLEISTOCENE?
NO SIDE-HILL GASHES ANYWHERE NORTH OF VERNON IN TODAY'S TRAVERSE.
BASALT WEST OF VERNON ON THE HILLS BETWEEN THE TOWN AND THE MAIN VALLEY OF OKANOGAN LAKE.

VICINITY OF IDEAL LakE
AUGUST 10 1926
IDEAL LAKE LIES ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE PLATEAU ALREDY NOTED, AND ITS DRAINAGE SPILLS
OVER INTO MISSION CREEK BY A STEEP GRADIENT. THE LAKE, NO" ENLARGED INTO THE B.M. I.D. RESER-
VOIR, REQUIRES THREE DAMS TO CLOSE THE BASIN. THE VALLEYS THUS CLOSED ARE IN THE SHUSWAP
GNEISS EXCEPT THE WESTERN ONE WHICH HAS GNEISS ON THE EAST B/ SIDE AND BOTTOM, AND BASALT ON THE


89
WEST SIDE.
NO ACTUAL CONTACT FOUND.
THE BASALT IS COLUMNAR, THE COLUMNS SOMEWHAT IRREGULARLY DISPOSED AND TO A SMALL EXTENT IT
IS SCORIACEOUS.
IT IS A VERY BLACK BASALT AND ITS WEATHERING COLOR IS RUSTY BROWNY, NOT GREY.
THIS BASALT CONSTITUTES A CLIFF ALONG THE LAKE FOR HALF A MIEE.
ABOVE IT AND FARTHER BACK
ARE OTHER LEDGES OR SEMI-CLIFFS WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE REACH 350 FEET ABOVE THE LAKE, ALL OF IT
BASALT.
THESE CLIFFS CONSTITUTE THE WEST SIDE OF THE LAKE VALLEY.
THE BAST SIDE CONSISTS
WHOLLY OF GNEISS
THERE IS NO TRACE OF BASALT.
AND GOOD AUTHORITY- AN INDIAN GUIDE WHO
KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BASALT AND GNEISS AND WHO HAS MADE MOST OF THE TRAILS ON THIS UPLAND-
SAYS THAT THERE IS NOTHING BUT THE GNEISS EAST TO THE SUMMIT OF BUCK HILLS.
NOW IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE BASALT ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE LAKE SHOULD REMAIN IN STEEP
CLIFFS WHILE ITS FORMER EXTENSION ACROSS TO THE FLANKS OF BUCK MT. SHOULD LOSE ALL TRACE OF BASALT.
ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS PLATEAU HAS SUCH GENTLE GRADIENTS AND ON THE MARGINS, PiTCHES OFF STEEPLY
INTO THE HEADS OF HIGH- GRADIENT DRAINAGE LINES.
AN INTERPRETATION MUCH TO BE PREFERRED IS
THAT THIS WESTERN SLOPE OF IDEAL LAKE IS A CONSTRUCTIONAL SLOPE, AT LEAST IN LARGE PART.
THE
LAVA FLOWS NEVER EXTENDED FARTHER EAST.
SEVERAL PROMINENT ELEVATIONS BETWEEN IDEAL LAKE AND HADDO LAKE, TWO ORT THREE ARE ROUND-
ISH HILLS 200 TO 300 FEET HIGH.
TWO CASES OF CLIFFS WHICH , WITH TALUS RECKONED IN , ARE 150 TO
250 FEET HIGH.
ALL OF THESE ARE OF BASALT, ONLY A FEW KNOBS OF DODER ROCK OUTCROPPING IN THE
LOWER PLACES AMONG THEM.
THEY ARE LAVA CONES, LIKE THE LARGER ONE NEAR ABERDEEN LAKE.
THIS
LARGER ONE APPEARS TO BE WIDER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED.
IT HAS A GENTLER WESTERN SLOPE, A SLOPE
WHICH BECOMES STEEPER AS IT COMES TO THE WALL OF DUTEAU CREEK.
PERHAPS A SECTION SHOWING THE
BASE OF THE BASALT MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE WALL OF THIS CREEK VALLEY.
THE BASALT IN THE HILLS ABOUT WOLASTON LAKE HAS HUGE COLUMNS, THREE OR FOUR FEET IN DIAMETER.
THERE STAND PERPENDICULAR AND DETERMINE VERTICAL WALLS.
THERE IS MINOR BOINTING IN EACH COLUM
BUT VERY LITTLE, IF ANY, PLATINESS.
THIS BASALT HAS SOME REMARKABLE SEGREGATIONS OF OLIVINE IN SOME PARTS OF IT.
MOST OF THEM
ARE ABOUT AN INCH OR TWO IN DIAMETER BUT SOME ARE 3 OR 4, AND ONE WAS FOUND 2X6X8, ALL PURE GRAN-
ULAR CHRYSOTILE.
ONE SEGREGATION , COMPOSED OF PLAGIOCLASE, WITH A FEW XLS OF RUTILE OR ILMEN-
LITE.
VERY LITTLE SCORIAGEOUS TEXTURE; THAT WHICH IS PRESENT IS COMMONLY FILLED WITH MILKWHITE

VICINITY OF IDEAL LAKE
AUGUST 11 1926
BASALT/BLUFF WEST OF THE LAKE CLIMBED.
IT IS NOT BASALT FROM BOTTOM TO TOP (ABT 350 T).
THE BASALT IS REALLY A VENEER, THICK IN PLACES, THIN IN OTHERS, ABSENT IN SOME.
THE DENSE FOREST
MAKES AN EXAMINATION VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY UNSATISFACTORY.
BUT THE SHUSWAP GNEISS IS A
COMMON OUTCROP AT THE TOP OF THE SLOPE.
THIS RELATIONSHIP SEEMS TO BE THE RULE ON THE PLATEAU-
THE BASALT IS NOT THICK ANYWHERE EXCEPT IN THE CONES, AND NOT VERY THICK EVEN THERE.
THE CONE
EAST OF WOLASTON LAKE APPEARS TO BE OF BASALT ALL THE WAY DOWN THE EAST S&PE BUT HAS SHUSWAP ROCK
LEDGES ON THE WEST SIDE AT LEAST 150 FEET ABOVETHE BASE.
CURIOUS THAT MOST OF THE CONESARE CLIFFED ON THE EAST


UP IN THE WOODSABOUT AT THE TOP OF THE SLOPE AND SOUTH OF THE LARGE CREEK WHICH ENTERS THE
LAKE OUTLET HALF A MILE BELOW THE DAM, IS A REMARKABLE BASALT HILL.
IT IS 60-70 WEET W/A. IN
MAXIMUM HEIGHT, IS LINEAR IN SHAPE, ABOUT 500 FEET LONG AND HAS SLOPES OF 30° AND 35°. IT IS
ALL BROKEN BASALT TALUS TO THE RIDGE CREST. THERE IS NO SOIL AND NO FOREIGN ROCK FRAGMENTS WERE
FOUND. THE RIDGE SETS ON AN IRREGULAR PLATFORM OF HEAVILY GLACIATED BARE GNEISS.
On THis
GNEISSIC PEDIMENT ARE A FEW HUGE BOULDERS OF BASALT, COMPOSED OF CLUSTERS OF COLUMNS, WHICH HAVE
CLEARLY ROLLED OUT THERE ON THE GLACIATED SURFACE BY REASON OF THEIR GREAGER MOMENTUM THAN THAT
POSSESSED BY SMALLER FRAGMENTS.
THE WHOLE TALUS HAS GROWN OUT ON THE GLACIATED GNEISS.
NOW THE RIDGE IS ORIENTED NEARLY EAST-WEST, WHILE THE GLACIAL ICE MOVED FROM THE NORTH.
AND
THE ONLY WAY BY WHICH THE GNEISS COULD BE STRONGLY GLACIATED BY WISCONSIN ICE AND THE RIDGE COULD
BE DRIFT-PREE AND STAND ON THE GNEISS PLATFORM, IS TO BUILD THE RIDGE AFTER THE WISCONS IN GLACIATION.
THIS MEANS, THEN, THAT VULCANISM HERE, AS AT COOKSON, POSTDATES GLACIATION- AND STRENGTHENS THE
ARGUMENT THAT THE MAIN PERIOD OF VULCANISM ON THIS PLATEAU WAS PLEISTOCENE.
THE BASALT OF THIS LINEAR POST-GLACIAL (?) EXTRUSION HAS PHENOCRYSTS OF A DARK FLDSPR OR A
LIGHT PYROXENE OR AMPHIBOLE.
NO OTHER BASALT SEEN ON THE PLATEAU HAS TIS CHARACTER.
FOR
HALF A MILE SOUTH OF THIS HILL (EXCEPTING THE BARE GNEISS. IMMEDIATELY SOUTH) THE DRIFT CONTAINS
A LARGE PROPORTION OF THIS LAVA IT SEEMS CLEARLY TO HAVE COME FROM THE HILL.
IF IT DID, THE
HILL IS NOT POSTGLACIAL UNLESS THERE HAS BEEN RENEWED EXTISSION OF THE SAME KIND OF LAVA FROM THE
SAME VENT.
IF THE HILL REALLY IS PREWISCONSIN, THE ABSENCE OF ERRATICS MAY BE ASCRIBED DO POST -
GLACIAL BREAKING UP OF THE BASALT, BUT THE SMOOTHED GNEISS IMMEDIATELY SOUTH OF BHE STEEP LITTLE
HILL SEEMS VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN UNLESS BY SOME POSSIBLITY THIS SMOOTHING DATES BACK TO THE
SPOKANE GLACIATION.
THE REMARKABLE SHARPNESS OF FORM AND SHARP LIMITATION OF DISTRIBUTION OF THE BASALT INDICATE
THIS HILL TO EE CONSTBUCTIONAL, NOT EROSIONAL IN ORIGIN.
IT IS A VERY VISCID EXUDATION OF F7
REMARKABLY LIMITED EXTENT. ITS ORIGIN AS SUCH POINTS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE PRE-MISCONS IN BASALT
HILLS OF THE PLATEAU AS SIMILAR FEATURES, AND WEAKENS THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE WEATURES AS
EROSIONAL REMNANTS OF A MUCH OLDER AND FAIRLY COMPLETE COVER.
THE UPLAND AT 4500,5000 AnD 5500 WEST OF THE BRAD TO IDEAL LAKE IS ALL SHUSWAP GNEISS. | TS
SLOPES ARE GENTLE, AS BEFITS THE UPLANDS OF AN OLD LAND.
CLIFFS IN GNEISS ARE VERY RARE AND
WHERE PRESENT ARE INCONSPICUOUS AFFAIRS ON THE PLATEAU, WHILE MOST EVERY BASALT AREA HAS ONE PROMINENT
CLIFFED MARGIN, PERHAPS MORE.
A BASALT CONE, WITH EASTERN CLIFF, FACING MISSION CREEK VALLEY STANDS AT 4600 AT 2 MILES SOUTH
OF THE NORTBERN MARGIN OF THE KETTLE VALLEY SHEET AND ABOUT ONE MILE WEST OF MISSION CREEK AND THE
IDEAL LAKE ROAD.
THE CONVENTIONAL LARGE COLUMNS IN VERTICAL POSITION ARE EXPOSED ABOVE THE KK
LARGE ACCUMULATION OF TALUS.
NORTHERN SLOPE OF THE HILL IS SMOOTHED BY GLACIAL EROSION.
THE
EASTERN LIMTT OF BASALT HERE IS THE EDGE OF THE TALUS- THE SHARP LIMITATION BEING LIKE THAT
ELSEWHERE.
THE HILL IS ABOUT 100 FEET HIGH.
ANOTHER BASALT HILL, 150 FEET OR SO HIGH, STANDS BETWEEN THE TWO OUTLETS OF THE LAKE RESERVOIR
IT HAS A STEEP WESTERN FRONT AND A STEEP EASTERN FRONT, AND A BASEMENT OF GNEISS, FAIRLY PLANE.
THE MAIN OUTLET (THE WESTERN ONE) CUTS INTO THE WESTERN FLANK AND APPARENTLY A PART OF THE LAVA
CONE LIES WEST OF THE CREEK.
OUTCROPS OF A VOLCANIC AGGLOMERATE ARE JUST ABOVE THE ROAD NORTH
OF THE CREEK.
THIS AGGLOMERATE CONTAINS FRAGMENTS OF NON-VOCCANIC MATERIAL WHICH MUST BE


COLLECTED AND IDENTIFIED.S VERAL GOOD XLS OF A TRANSPARENT MINERAL WITH GOOD CLEAVAGE, HARDER
THAN STEEL. IT MAY BE TOPAZ. JAITHIS IS A QUEER COMBINATION CRYSTALS AN INCH IN DIAMETER

IT IS A RIDGE WHICH BIFURCATES DOWN HILL AND BECOMES TWO RIDGES TOWARD THE DERMINUS. jeSITS caEN
LENGTH MUST BE MORE THAN 1000 FEET. ITS BROAD CREST DESCENDS 80 FEET OR A LITTLE MORE IN THAT
DISTANCE.
ITS HEIGHT ABOVE THE ADJACENT SLOPE IS ONLY A FEW FEETAT THE UPPER END BUT NEARLY 100
FEET AT THE DOWNHILL TERMINUS OF THE LARGER ARM.
NOTHING BUT THE SHUSWAP GNEISS IS EXPOSED
ON EITHER SIDE AND THERE ARE NO RAVINES OR SPURS OR OTHER COMPARABLE RELIEF OF THE GEISSIC
SURFACE.
THIS BASALT RIDGE CLEARLY IS A TRICKLE FLOW DOWN THE EXISTING MT. SLOPE, A TRICKLE
THAT STARTED NEAR THE R TRAX AND THICKENED LIKE A CONGEALING FLOW OF WAX TOWARD THE LOWER END.
THE PERFECTION OF THE FORMS IT NOW STANDS PROOVES THIS FLOW TO HAVE BEEN LATE PLEISTOCENE. IT
IS PRE-WISCONSIN, HOWEVER, AND BEARS STRIAE WHICH STRIKE $ 5-10° E.
ANOTHER SMALL AREA OF BASALT IS CUT BY THE R EXCAVATIONS HALF A MILE WEST OF THE STATION

CAMSELL'S CONCEPTION OF AN OLD TERTIARY VOLCANO, BROKEN DOWN NOW INTO RUGGED CRAGGY HILLS AND
BASINS AMONG THEM, IS UNQUESTIONABLY WRONG. ST THE BASINS ARE DUE TO DRIFT DAMS, NOT ROCK
BARRIERS, AND THE SHORT CRAGGY HILLS ARE THESE HILLS OF GLACIAL LUCKING AND EROSION. TILTED
SHALES WITH CARBONACEOUS SEAMS IN THEM ARE POOR MATERIALS FBR VOLCANIC CRATER WALLS. SHEARED AND
FRACTURED LAVAS ALSO.

ONE REASON FOR THE UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF SHORT HILLS AND SHALLOW VALLEYS IN THE VICINITY OF WHITE
LAKE PERHAPS IS THAT THIS IS PROBABLY THE SITE OF A PREGACIAL DIVIDE. THE NARROW VASEAUX LAKE
GATEWAY WAS REMARKED LAST YEAR.A THE TRAVERSE THIS YEAR FROM THE WEST SIDE. OF DOG LAKE TO FAIR-
VIEW BY A ROAD WHICH CLIMBS SEVERAL HUNDRED WEET ABOVE OKANOGAN LAKE. A IT IS A LOW UPLAND, 04
FRETTED WITH THESE GURUS BAGGED KNOBBY HILLS AND TRENCHED BY ONE DEEP GASH. WHY GLACIAL. IOE
SHOULD PLUCK OR BITE IN THIS FASHION TO PRODUCE THIS TOPOGRAPHY IS A PUZZLE. IT HARDLY SEEMS THAT
VARIATIONS IN ERODABILITY OR PLUCKABILITY COULD BE SO IRREGULARLY DISTRIBUTED. SO THE SAME SITUA-
TION SEEMS TO BE SHOWN IN SEVERAL OTHER PLACES SEEN DURING THE PAST FOUR WEEKS.
